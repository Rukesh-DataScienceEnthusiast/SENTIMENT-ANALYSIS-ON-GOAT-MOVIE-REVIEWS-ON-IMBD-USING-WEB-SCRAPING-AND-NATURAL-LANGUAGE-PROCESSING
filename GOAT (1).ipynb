De-ageing looked decent, but the VFX and production values are average.<br/><br/>Coming to Venkat Prabhu, on paper, this looks a good idea, 1st half was decently engaging, but second half was below par. Few meta references, cameos worked, but this needed MANKATHA Level direction.<br/><br/>Bottomline: Watch it if you wanna see the sinister side of Vijay.</div>\n",

Though he is not a main villain but the entire story revolves around his revenge and so could have had a better villain who make impact with eyes &amp; dialogues. De-aging worked out very well and its treat to watch \"Ilaya\" thalapathy.<br/><br/>Story like this require nail biting screen play for the audience to sit at the corner of their seats with interesting twists which gives turns in the story.

Thalapathy Vijay's remarkable performance and his screen presence stands out. His swagger and comic timings make us captivated. The execution of the film's action sequences is excellent. This film's final 40-minute climax is among the best I've seen. There are lot of twists and turns particularly in the second half of the movie. This film is a complete package commercial entertainer and it is repeat worthy. Everyone should see the movie at the cinemas to enjoy the theatrical experience.</div>\n",

In-between it become so predictable and filled with some cringe surprises.<br/><br/>The De-Aging (especially around Lip area) killed lot of mass moments. Just because of De-aging, the mass moments are miserably failed to young Vijay but Old Vijay is ultimate to watch. Guna movie reference is top notch Cringe, just because of this De-Aging.<br/><br/>The excitement ends when the intro song over and it started again when climax Matta song starts. The first half is so predictable. The second half looks lengthy, but managed with cameo and surprises.<br/><br/>Mohan is big miscast, another miscast is Yuvan. We missed Aniruth in lot of places. There were more claps/excitement from audience for old BGM than the current movie BGM.<br/><br/>One time watchable because of Vijay.</div>\n",

              "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">PS: I am biased to MSD, CSK, VP.<br/><br/>It's very difficult to cook an agent movie with a star hero in the South. Vivegam came close but it failed to appeal to all the sections (I like Vivegam btw). We dont even want to talk about Spyder.<br/><br/>So, VP and AGS smartly cooked it safe, made it appealing for everybody, promoted the movie saying the same thing, did not give it much hype, added cameos, did fan service, maintained the graph throughout so that everybody comes out with a satisfactory feeling.<br/><br/>Did the movie has flaws? Of course, yes. But, it doesn't matter as long as you want to just have some time pass fun and leave the theatre.<br/><br/>I wouldn't watch it for a second time barring few good scenes here and there. But, for a onetime watch time I would recommend.<br/><br/>Glad for VP as he didn't lose his touch yet unlike his contemporaries. He is still in form.</div>\n",

So when vijay joined hands with VP in his pen ultimate movie before his political entry,it was either going to be in the top leagues like mankatha or in the bare bottom like mass.<br/><br/>Just like every vijay movies nowadays, the hype was surreal.<br/><br/>The movie begins with the squad going on a mission somewhere in Kenya. After the usual opening fight sequences what follows is a tiring family moments (made for the family audiences)which could have been made better.<br/><br/>The first half faces a lag with predictable screenplay but the peak point of the movie is the final 40 minutes or so ,where it keeps your adrenaline pumping throughout with delightful cameos and twists ..\n",
              "The big letdown though is yuvan's bgms and songs. Especially the spark song.

              "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Watched \"GOAT\" early this morning at 6:30 am, and what an experience it was! Director #VenkatPrabhu has outdone himself with this one, delivering a movie that feels like a rollercoaster ride around the globe. It's not just an action-packed thriller but also a heartfelt family drama with plenty of humor, unexpected twists, and nods to #Vijay's iconic filmography.<br/><br/>#ThalapathyVijay takes on two vastly different roles, showcasing his versatility like never before. It's a refreshing change from his recent films, and he absolutely nails it. The first half of the movie is gripping, thanks to @vp_offl's masterful storytelling and a mind-blowing interval block that sets the stage for an exhilarating second half.<br/><br/>Post-interval, the pace never slows down. The action sequences are slick and stylish, with plenty of whistle-worthy moments that will have fans cheering in their seats. Thalapathy Vijay shines throughout, bringing his signature charm, emotional depth, and flawless dance moves. Whether it's delivering a punchline or a punch, he's in top form, connecting effortlessly with fans and family audiences alike<br/><br/>A heartfelt tribute to Captain #Vijayakanth is woven seamlessly into the narrative, adding another layer of emotion. The climax is a high point, leaving you on the edge of your seat and craving more. Despite its 3-hour runtime, the movie feels brisk and engaging-it's a thrill ride you won't mind taking again.<br/><br/>Kudos to producer @archanakalpathi for bringing this grand spectacle to the big screen.

Gandhi (Vijay) is an SATS officer along with his buddies/colleagues Sunil (Prashanth), Kalyan (Prabhudeva), Ajay (Ajmal Ameer) and their boss is Naseer (Jayaram). They almost capture the dreaded criminal Rajiv Menon (Mohan) who once was their boss, now turned terrorist but the mission is still successful in retrieving the Uranium. Rajiv is presumed train in the aftermath of the mission. The work obviously affects the personal life of Gandhi and a mission in Thailand leads to an attack on his family, resulting in a personal loss which impacts his marital life. Years later, Gandhi is no longer a field agent and the demons from his past catch upto him. With his loved ones life at stake, how does Gandhi resolve the threat, forms rest of the story.<br/><br/>Watching a 4am fans show for a Vijay film is an unique experience which I have enjoyed in the past too. Thankfully, Venkat Prabhu has given a better Vijay film compared to his recent outings and this is not to say, Venkat Prabhu has given a perfect outing. The screenplay had to compromised big time to turn it into a star vehicle for Vijay and the first half has hardly any twists. It succeeds in fan service which in turn helps the first half sail through without much complaints.<br/><br/>It is the second half which has all the gimmicks and sadly the proceedings gets way too predictable, relying heavily on the gimmicks to save the film. Now there is a positive to this as well considering the gimmicks give the best moments. There are couple classic Venkat Prabhu twists which is executed well and a couple of more predictable twists. The music is a big letdown and the songs only act as a speedbreaker for an already long film. This is Vijay's finest performance as he aces in both the roles of father and son. The writing suffers from focusing majorly on Vijay's characters which leaves several supporting cast to be underwritten which impacts the film in crucial moments. The climax is prolonged but the cameos give out the high as intended, making this into a decent watch. I am going with a lenient rating because it did entertain me well in parts and the very fact that, given the last few films of Vijay, this stands tall. This definitely is among the 5 better Vijay films to come out since 2010. If only the runtime was kept in check and better music, GOAT truly could have been the best of Vijay, whereas performance wise it definitely is.</div>\n",

Moreover, we could applaud VP for few things that taking very normal story and building the screenplay with few interesting twists and keeping you engaged to some extend for 3 hours is definitely not an easy task to do. But, he done that with ease. Matter of fact that de-aging work was amazing and unbelievable though I personaly did not convince the way Vijay perfomed the jeevan character. It looks cringe in few instances especially during the second half. Let's talk about the supporting roles, Prasanth has done a good job, Prabu Deva and Sneha was decent. Mohan and Meenakshi is definitely a miscast. Other people does not have anything to do with a movie. There are few surprises which are interesting. Yuvan songs are big let down and bgm was decent. VFX looks very bad that is not acceptable for a big budget film like GOAT. Few dialogues were ametaure and there is a room for atleast 15min trimming in second half. Finally, VP manages to deliver the engaging and decent entertainer that could have been better. But, it's definitely not even closer to MANKATHA.</div>\n",

              "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Venkat Prabhu, known for his unique style in Tamil cinema, once had a distinct touch that won over audiences. However, his recent ventures seem to suggest otherwise. The decline in his storytelling, direction, and overall execution is evident, leaving many to wonder if he has lost his golden touch.<br/><br/>When it comes to cinema, hype plays a significant role. Some movies are massively marketed, creating an inflated sense of expectation. However, there are times when films fail to live up to that hype, and Venkat Prabhu's recent movie is an unfortunate example of this. Fans of the director, who once brought innovative films like *Chennai 600028* and *Saroja*, were left disappointed with his recent release, which can easily be described as one of the worst in his career.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the lack of a coherent screenplay was glaring. A movie thrives on its screenplay-it's the backbone of any narrative. Without a compelling and structured storyline, even a star-studded cast can't save a film from falling apart. In Venkat Prabhu's recent outing, the screenplay felt disjointed, with no clear direction. The audience was left wondering where the plot was headed, and that's never a good sign. Several scenes seemed like they were written just to fill in time, lacking any purpose or contribution to the overarching narrative. It became increasingly frustrating to follow a story that seemed to meander without any sense of purpose or focus.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the dialogues lacked the spark that was once synonymous with Venkat Prabhu's films. His earlier films were known for witty lines, cultural references, and a blend of humor with emotional depth. However, this time around, it felt forced. There were moments where the dialogues felt unnatural, and rather than drawing the audience into the story, they only served to alienate them further.<br/><br/>Another critical aspect was the music, which was incredibly disappointing. Music often plays a crucial role in the success of a film, especially in Indian cinema, where songs are a vital part of storytelling. However, the songs in this film were far from memorable. It's almost shocking to see how the music, usually a strength in Venkat Prabhu's films, fell flat here. The tunes were generic and lacked the energy or emotion necessary to resonate with the audience. They felt like mere fillers, thrown in to check a box rather than enhancing the overall narrative. It begs the question: has Venkat Prabhu lost his touch in selecting or directing the music in his films?<br/><br/>Moreover, the performances of the actors couldn't salvage the film either. While the cast had some recognizable faces, they seemed out of place, and it was clear that they were struggling to work with the weak script. The lack of chemistry between the actors was palpable, and it was difficult to connect with any of the characters on screen. This was surprising, especially considering Venkat Prabhu's previous ability to bring out the best in his ensemble casts. The entire movie felt like a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>In a world where audiences are increasingly looking for fresh, well-told stories, the film was outdated. The usual charm, wit, and creativity that once defined Venkat Prabhu's movies were glaringly absent. One might even argue that he is stuck in a time warp, still banking on the elements that worked for him a decade ago, without realizing that the audience's taste has evolved.<br/><br/>All in all, this film stands as one of the worst not just in Venkat Prabhu's career but in recent Tamil cinema. It wasn't worth the hype it garnered, and for those who went in with expectations, the disappointment was evident. It's a film that will likely be forgotten in no time, and one can only hope that Venkat Prabhu takes this as a learning experience and returns to the form that made him a beloved filmmaker in the first place. His latest venture GOAT leaves us wondering: has he truly lost his touch.</div>\n",

What we get is a 3 hour long drag fest of well knitted scenes backed by raucous music, flower pot female character and a generous sparkling of supporting characters.<br/><br/>Vijay as Gandhi and Jeevan was excellent and the de-aging technology worked well. Other than these two aspects, GOAT offers nothing else. The story, if any, is as predictable as sunrise. The needless call backs to Vijay's past movies were done to please the masses. They were abrupt .<br/><br/>The story never settles until the second half of Act 2 and suddenly we get a barrage twists, if which, you would've guessed most of them by that time.<br/><br/>Bottom line, this is not GOAT.

First half is quick in story building whereas second half is a little bit shaggy but climax lifted the second half. Bgm is nice but songs are not up to the level.. Thalapathy Vijay carries the whole film with his negative shade. Maybe they should concentrated on story...But commercial elements are at peak. Cameos are placed nice.

              "Anyway this film delivers what it promised a thrill ride of action adventure with celebrating its lead actor in a dual role what else do you need.. It's a no brainer that many of things in film are cliches and are done for many times in past but still this movie was fun although it didn't match up to levels of Vijay's last Film LEO.. Action scenes were good, fight scenes were good and nicely choreographed, at least some of them.. Story was typical secret agent story mixed with family drama like we've seen hundred times before.. BGM was okay not very good, runtime could've been at least 20 minutes shorter.. This film is made for fans of Thalapathy who don't care about anything else other than seeing him.. I've only seen his 3 more films Master, Beast and Leo and this one was weakest of all of them.. Vfx were also just okay. De aging effects on younger Vijay looks fake in some scenes but he delivered a decent performence in both roles.. Rest of cast also acted well even though I don't recognize any of them since I don't watch South Indian movies too much.. Overall it is an decent film meant only for die hard fans of Vijay but rest of audience will also enjoy it.. Will you see it in theatre or skip it for OTT is up to you.. You don't miss anything special..\n",

              "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">It is true that Venkat Prabhu has made a perfect commercial film for Tamil cinema especially squirrels after a long time!. Although the film has a very simple story, the script was spiced up enough for a commercial cinema and it was good to eat!. The squirrels have been asking the directors who are going to make a film with Vijay for a long time, Venkat Prabhu brought out another angle of \"Vijay\" and handled it \"70%\" and Vijay established it with his performance, like \"Priyamudan\" directed by Vincent Selva in 1998, can add success to the film! (The movie \"Priyamudan\" is known only to real squirrel chicks). Why is it that when an artist creates a work (whether it's purely \"art\" or \"business\") we associate the artwork with the epics that artist has created before? Some artists create their new work for a purpose, and the question is, what wins? Does it fit the purpose? In that way, Yuvan Shankar Raja's music was appropriate when watching this commercial movie!. While the de-aging process is perfect at many points, it would have been better if they had worked on the VFX scenes (truthfully there is only so much that can be done for the budget and time given here) except for a few songs and some unnecessary intros. The film is like a road trip for the squirrels who only think of Vijay from top to bottom!</div>\n",

              "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Venkat Prabhu's latest film is a well-crafted narrative that grips the audience from start to finish, proving once again why he remains one of the most promising filmmakers in contemporary cinema. The storyline is not only engaging but also filled with twists that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. From the very beginning, the director ensures that there's a consistent pace, avoiding unnecessary lulls that could lose the audience's attention. This balance in pacing is critical to maintaining a sense of excitement and intrigue throughout the film's running time.<br/><br/>What stands out in this film is the treatment of characters. Each major character has been given equal importance, which is often a challenge in ensemble casts. Venkat Prabhu ensures that no one is sidelined or underutilized. This not only allows for more depth in the story but also makes the audience invest in the characters on an emotional level. Every character has their moment to shine, and their arcs are interconnected in a way that feels organic rather than forced. This is an admirable feat of storytelling, as keeping multiple characters relevant while maintaining narrative flow can be tricky. In this film, however, the characters' journeys are woven together seamlessly, contributing to the overall impact of the story.<br/><br/>One of the most striking aspects of the movie is the antagonist. The villainous role is crafted with a level of detail and flair that elevates the character into one of the film's most memorable features. The antagonist's presence is not just a typical opposition to the protagonist but a fully realized character with motivations that make them stand out. The way the antagonist is portrayed is hellishly awesome and genuinely celebrates the darker side of human nature in a way that feels fresh and exciting. It's a character that fans will likely remember long after the credits roll, as they bring an intensity and charisma that lifts the entire narrative.<br/><br/>The visuals in the film are another strong point. Venkat Prabhu's direction is complemented by stunning cinematography, which adds a layer of immersion to the overall experience. The way certain scenes are shot, coupled with the film's color palette and visual effects, makes it a visual spectacle. Fans of the director will appreciate the attention to detail and the way he uses visual storytelling to enhance the narrative. Whether it's the intense action sequences or the quieter, more emotionally charged moments, the visual composition consistently enhances the story, making it a true treat to watch on the big screen.<br/><br/>While the film excels in many areas, one aspect that could have been better is the music. Yuvan Shankar Raja, who has delivered iconic soundtracks in the past, falls just short of the high expectations set for him. The background score and songs, while not bad by any means, don't reach the heights one might hope for in a Venkat Prabhu film. However, this minor shortcoming does not detract too much from the overall experience. The music serves its purpose and complements the film, even if it isn't as memorable as some of Yuvan's previous work.<br/><br/>Overall, Venkat Prabhu delivers a movie that is sure to entertain a wide range of audiences. The film is packed with engaging characters, an exceptional antagonist, and visuals that make it worth experiencing in theaters. Fans of the director and the genre will find plenty to enjoy, while even casual viewers will appreciate the high-quality production values and the tightly woven narrative. Despite some minor hiccups with the music, the film is an exciting and well-executed piece of entertainment that should not be missed. Whether you are a die-hard fan or someone looking for a fun theatrical experience, this film is definitely worth watching at least once.</div>\n",

Venkat Prabhu and Premji mentioned that they did something like Sivaji the boss for Vijay but GOAT is not even near Sivaji. The story evolves around a son and his father. Very small scaled story although this film travels around so many places.<br/><br/>Cinematography was okayish, Yuvan's background score was good but could've done better. Commercial films are known for having a good album, this film lacks a good audio album. I don't understand why directors can't understand that a movie's duration should be around 2h 30m to 2h 40m. You don't have to drag till 3hrs.<br/><br/>Overall: one time watchable entertainer. 6/10.<br/><br/>Strictly for Vijay fans but general audience may find a lot of mistakes in the film.</div>\n",

Bad vfx.<br/><br/>Also child torture scenes are shown, it should be shown labl as violence towards children are punishable. It's not shown. Very mind disturbing scenes.<br/><br/>One of the worst film of Vijay.<br/><br/>Continuous Bad films Vijay Giving.<br/><br/>It's a story of a secret agent. Poor story.

            "Review 1: The same issue like previous Vijay movies since Mersal, promises so much, only to flatter to deceiveAnd it's usual Thalapathy show all the way, he tried as hard as he can to save the day, by donning the Ilayathalapathy character as well, but the script offered him only so much, after a point, it's exhausting.Rest of the cast have got absolutely nothing character or story wise, but the most laughable character is Meenakshi's, even GK character was better than this.Technically, it doesn't feel we are watching a big budget movie, shaky cinematography, movie needs serious trimming of 20-25 minutes, action was fine in bits and pieces, Yuvan's work is outright disaster, neither the songs worked nor BGM, horrible. De-ageing looked decent, but the VFX and production values are average.Coming to Venkat Prabhu, on paper, this looks a good idea, 1st half was decently engaging, but second half was below par. Few meta references, cameos worked, but this needed MANKATHA Level direction.Bottomline: Watch it if you wanna see the sinister side of Vijay.\n",

            "Review 3: Casts were well utilised but there is a slight drag in screenplay. Twists were working out only at that moment but failed to take the moment to momentum.Villain role is not suited for Mohan. Though he is not a main villain but the entire story revolves around his revenge and so could have had a better villain who make impact with eyes & dialogues. De-aging worked out very well and its treat to watch \"Ilaya\" thalapathy.Story like this require nail biting screen play for the audience to sit at the corner of their seats with interesting twists which gives turns in the story. Seems like director worked towards it but lost to the stardom.Thalapathy is fantastic treat to watch in the screen.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 4: The movie feels like it was made primarily for the fans, with little attention given to crafting a compelling storyline. Unfortunately, the plot is quite weak, failing to engage the audience effectively. The background music (BGM) doesn't add much value and lacks the impact that could have elevated key moments.Visually, the movie also falls short, with subpar makeup and VFX that don't meet expectations, leaving certain scenes underwhelming. There are some cameo appearances, but they do little to lift the overall experience.In conclusion, the movie is an average offering that serves as a one-time watch.

Thalapathy Vijay's remarkable performance and his screen presence stands out. His swagger and comic timings make us captivated. The execution of the film's action sequences is excellent. This film's final 40-minute climax is among the best I've seen. There are lot of twists and turns particularly in the second half of the movie. This film is a complete package commercial entertainer and it is repeat worthy. Everyone should see the movie at the cinemas to enjoy the theatrical experience.\n",

In-between it become so predictable and filled with some cringe surprises.The De-Aging (especially around Lip area) killed lot of mass moments. Just because of De-aging, the mass moments are miserably failed to young Vijay but Old Vijay is ultimate to watch. Guna movie reference is top notch Cringe, just because of this De-Aging.The excitement ends when the intro song over and it started again when climax Matta song starts. The first half is so predictable. The second half looks lengthy, but managed with cameo and surprises.Mohan is big miscast, another miscast is Yuvan. We missed Aniruth in lot of places. There were more claps/excitement from audience for old BGM than the current movie BGM.One time watchable because of Vijay.\n",

Vivegam came close but it failed to appeal to all the sections (I like Vivegam btw). We dont even want to talk about Spyder.So, VP and AGS smartly cooked it safe, made it appealing for everybody, promoted the movie saying the same thing, did not give it much hype, added cameos, did fan service, maintained the graph throughout so that everybody comes out with a satisfactory feeling.Did the movie has flaws? Of course, yes. But, it doesn't matter as long as you want to just have some time pass fun and leave the theatre.I wouldn't watch it for a second time barring few good scenes here and there.

After the usual opening fight sequences what follows is a tiring family moments (made for the family audiences)which could have been made better.The first half faces a lag with predictable screenplay but the peak point of the movie is the final 40 minutes or so ,where it keeps your adrenaline pumping throughout with delightful cameos and twists ..\n",

            "Review 13: Watched \"GOAT\" early this morning at 6:30 am, and what an experience it was! Director #VenkatPrabhu has outdone himself with this one, delivering a movie that feels like a rollercoaster ride around the globe. It's not just an action-packed thriller but also a heartfelt family drama with plenty of humor, unexpected twists, and nods to #Vijay's iconic filmography.#ThalapathyVijay takes on two vastly different roles, showcasing his versatility like never before. It's a refreshing change from his recent films, and he absolutely nails it. The first half of the movie is gripping, thanks to @vp_offl's masterful storytelling and a mind-blowing interval block that sets the stage for an exhilarating second half.Post-interval, the pace never slows down. The action sequences are slick and stylish, with plenty of whistle-worthy moments that will have fans cheering in their seats. Thalapathy Vijay shines throughout, bringing his signature charm, emotional depth, and flawless dance moves. Whether it's delivering a punchline or a punch, he's in top form, connecting effortlessly with fans and family audiences alikeA heartfelt tribute to Captain #Vijayakanth is woven seamlessly into the narrative, adding another layer of emotion. The climax is a high point, leaving you on the edge of your seat and craving more. Despite its 3-hour runtime, the movie feels brisk and engaging-it's a thrill ride you won't mind taking again.Kudos to producer @archanakalpathi for bringing this grand spectacle to the big screen. Technically, \"GOAT\" matches up with the best of Hollywood's action flicks, making it a true cinematic experience. This is a film you'll want to watch more than once, especially with your family!\n",

            "Review 14: M. S. Gandhi (Vijay) is an SATS officer along with his buddies/colleagues Sunil (Prashanth), Kalyan (Prabhudeva), Ajay (Ajmal Ameer) and their boss is Naseer (Jayaram). They almost capture the dreaded criminal Rajiv Menon (Mohan) who once was their boss, now turned terrorist but the mission is still successful in retrieving the Uranium. Rajiv is presumed train in the aftermath of the mission. The work obviously affects the personal life of Gandhi and a mission in Thailand leads to an attack on his family, resulting in a personal loss which impacts his marital life. Years later, Gandhi is no longer a field agent and the demons from his past catch upto him. With his loved ones life at stake, how does Gandhi resolve the threat, forms rest of the story.Watching a 4am fans show for a Vijay film is an unique experience which I have enjoyed in the past too. Thankfully, Venkat Prabhu has given a better Vijay film compared to his recent outings and this is not to say, Venkat Prabhu has given a perfect outing. The screenplay had to compromised big time to turn it into a star vehicle for Vijay and the first half has hardly any twists. It succeeds in fan service which in turn helps the first half sail through without much complaints.It is the second half which has all the gimmicks and sadly the proceedings gets way too predictable, relying heavily on the gimmicks to save the film. Now there is a positive to this as well considering the gimmicks give the best moments. There are couple classic Venkat Prabhu twists which is executed well and a couple of more predictable twists. The music is a big letdown and the songs only act as a speedbreaker for an already long film. This is Vijay's finest performance as he aces in both the roles of father and son. The writing suffers from focusing majorly on Vijay's characters which leaves several supporting cast to be underwritten which impacts the film in crucial moments. The climax is prolonged but the cameos give out the high as intended, making this into a decent watch. I am going with a lenient rating because it did entertain me well in parts and the very fact that, given the last few films of Vijay, this stands tall. This definitely is among the 5 better Vijay films to come out since 2010. If only the runtime was kept in check and better music, GOAT truly could have been the best of Vijay, whereas performance wise it definitely is.\n",

Venkat Prabhu shows the antagonist with a strong backstory and connects different elements together. Music is a big letdown and songs come abruptly. Three songs could have been cut, but the plot keeps you hooked.Action sequences are shot well. Comic timing is spot on, and certain scenes are hillarious.It's a complete family and action film barring few atrocious scenes which are not kids friendly.

Moreover, we could applaud VP for few things that taking very normal story and building the screenplay with few interesting twists and keeping you engaged to some extend for 3 hours is definitely not an easy task to do. But, he done that with ease. Matter of fact that de-aging work was amazing and unbelievable though I personaly did not convince the way Vijay perfomed the jeevan character. It looks cringe in few instances especially during the second half. Let's talk about the supporting roles, Prasanth has done a good job, Prabu Deva and Sneha was decent. Mohan and Meenakshi is definitely a miscast. Other people does not have anything to do with a movie. There are few surprises which are interesting. Yuvan songs are big let down and bgm was decent. VFX looks very bad that is not acceptable for a big budget film like GOAT. Few dialogues were ametaure and there is a room for atleast 15min trimming in second half. Finally, VP manages to deliver the engaging and decent entertainer that could have been better. But, it's definitely not even closer to MANKATHA.\n",

            "Review 17: Venkat Prabhu, known for his unique style in Tamil cinema, once had a distinct touch that won over audiences. However, his recent ventures seem to suggest otherwise. The decline in his storytelling, direction, and overall execution is evident, leaving many to wonder if he has lost his golden touch.When it comes to cinema, hype plays a significant role. Some movies are massively marketed, creating an inflated sense of expectation. However, there are times when films fail to live up to that hype, and Venkat Prabhu's recent movie is an unfortunate example of this. Fans of the director, who once brought innovative films like *Chennai 600028* and *Saroja*, were left disappointed with his recent release, which can easily be described as one of the worst in his career.First and foremost, the lack of a coherent screenplay was glaring. A movie thrives on its screenplay-it's the backbone of any narrative. Without a compelling and structured storyline, even a star-studded cast can't save a film from falling apart. In Venkat Prabhu's recent outing, the screenplay felt disjointed, with no clear direction. The audience was left wondering where the plot was headed, and that's never a good sign. Several scenes seemed like they were written just to fill in time, lacking any purpose or contribution to the overarching narrative. It became increasingly frustrating to follow a story that seemed to meander without any sense of purpose or focus.Furthermore, the dialogues lacked the spark that was once synonymous with Venkat Prabhu's films. His earlier films were known for witty lines, cultural references, and a blend of humor with emotional depth. However, this time around, it felt forced. There were moments where the dialogues felt unnatural, and rather than drawing the audience into the story, they only served to alienate them further.Another critical aspect was the music, which was incredibly disappointing. Music often plays a crucial role in the success of a film, especially in Indian cinema, where songs are a vital part of storytelling. However, the songs in this film were far from memorable. It's almost shocking to see how the music, usually a strength in Venkat Prabhu's films, fell flat here. The tunes were generic and lacked the energy or emotion necessary to resonate with the audience. They felt like mere fillers, thrown in to check a box rather than enhancing the overall narrative. It begs the question: has Venkat Prabhu lost his touch in selecting or directing the music in his films?Moreover, the performances of the actors couldn't salvage the film either. While the cast had some recognizable faces, they seemed out of place, and it was clear that they were struggling to work with the weak script. The lack of chemistry between the actors was palpable, and it was difficult to connect with any of the characters on screen. This was surprising, especially considering Venkat Prabhu's previous ability to bring out the best in his ensemble casts. The entire movie felt like a missed opportunity.In a world where audiences are increasingly looking for fresh, well-told stories, the film was outdated. The usual charm, wit, and creativity that once defined Venkat Prabhu's movies were glaringly absent. One might even argue that he is stuck in a time warp, still banking on the elements that worked for him a decade ago, without realizing that the audience's taste has evolved.All in all, this film stands as one of the worst not just in Venkat Prabhu's career but in recent Tamil cinema. It wasn't worth the hype it garnered, and for those who went in with expectations, the disappointment was evident. It's a film that will likely be forgotten in no time, and one can only hope that Venkat Prabhu takes this as a learning experience and returns to the form that made him a beloved filmmaker in the first place. His latest venture GOAT leaves us wondering: has he truly lost his touch.\n",

What we get is a 3 hour long drag fest of well knitted scenes backed by raucous music, flower pot female character and a generous sparkling of supporting characters.Vijay as Gandhi and Jeevan was excellent and the de-aging technology worked well. Other than these two aspects, GOAT offers nothing else. The story, if any, is as predictable as sunrise. The needless call backs to Vijay's past movies were done to please the masses. They were abrupt .The story never settles until the second half of Act 2 and suddenly we get a barrage twists, if which, you would've guessed most of them by that time.Bottom line, this is not GOAT.

It's a no brainer that many of things in film are cliches and are done for many times in past but still this movie was fun although it didn't match up to levels of Vijay's last Film LEO.. Action scenes were good, fight scenes were good and nicely choreographed, at least some of them.. Story was typical secret agent story mixed with family drama like we've seen hundred times before.. BGM was okay not very good, runtime could've been at least 20 minutes shorter.. This film is made for fans of Thalapathy who don't care about anything else other than seeing him.. I've only seen his 3 more films Master, Beast and Leo and this one was weakest of all of them.. Vfx were also just okay. De aging effects on younger Vijay looks fake in some scenes but he delivered a decent performence in both roles.. Rest of cast also acted well even though I don't recognize any of them since I don't watch South Indian movies too much.. Overall it is an decent film meant only for die hard fans of Vijay but rest of audience will also enjoy it.. Will you see it in theatre or skip it for OTT is up to you.. You don't miss anything special..\n",

            "Review 22: It is true that Venkat Prabhu has made a perfect commercial film for Tamil cinema especially squirrels after a long time!. Although the film has a very simple story, the script was spiced up enough for a commercial cinema and it was good to eat!. The squirrels have been asking the directors who are going to make a film with Vijay for a long time, Venkat Prabhu brought out another angle of \"Vijay\" and handled it \"70%\" and Vijay established it with his performance, like \"Priyamudan\" directed by Vincent Selva in 1998, can add success to the film! (The movie \"Priyamudan\" is known only to real squirrel chicks). Why is it that when an artist creates a work (whether it's purely \"art\" or \"business\") we associate the artwork with the epics that artist has created before? Some artists create their new work for a purpose, and the question is, what wins? Does it fit the purpose? In that way, Yuvan Shankar Raja's music was appropriate when watching this commercial movie!. While the de-aging process is perfect at many points, it would have been better if they had worked on the VFX scenes (truthfully there is only so much that can be done for the budget and time given here) except for a few songs and some unnecessary intros. The film is like a road trip for the squirrels who only think of Vijay from top to bottom!\n",

            "Review 23: Venkat Prabhu's latest film is a well-crafted narrative that grips the audience from start to finish, proving once again why he remains one of the most promising filmmakers in contemporary cinema. The storyline is not only engaging but also filled with twists that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. From the very beginning, the director ensures that there's a consistent pace, avoiding unnecessary lulls that could lose the audience's attention. This balance in pacing is critical to maintaining a sense of excitement and intrigue throughout the film's running time.What stands out in this film is the treatment of characters. Each major character has been given equal importance, which is often a challenge in ensemble casts. Venkat Prabhu ensures that no one is sidelined or underutilized. This not only allows for more depth in the story but also makes the audience invest in the characters on an emotional level. Every character has their moment to shine, and their arcs are interconnected in a way that feels organic rather than forced. This is an admirable feat of storytelling, as keeping multiple characters relevant while maintaining narrative flow can be tricky. In this film, however, the characters' journeys are woven together seamlessly, contributing to the overall impact of the story.One of the most striking aspects of the movie is the antagonist. The villainous role is crafted with a level of detail and flair that elevates the character into one of the film's most memorable features. The antagonist's presence is not just a typical opposition to the protagonist but a fully realized character with motivations that make them stand out. The way the antagonist is portrayed is hellishly awesome and genuinely celebrates the darker side of human nature in a way that feels fresh and exciting. It's a character that fans will likely remember long after the credits roll, as they bring an intensity and charisma that lifts the entire narrative.The visuals in the film are another strong point. Venkat Prabhu's direction is complemented by stunning cinematography, which adds a layer of immersion to the overall experience. The way certain scenes are shot, coupled with the film's color palette and visual effects, makes it a visual spectacle. Fans of the director will appreciate the attention to detail and the way he uses visual storytelling to enhance the narrative. Whether it's the intense action sequences or the quieter, more emotionally charged moments, the visual composition consistently enhances the story, making it a true treat to watch on the big screen.While the film excels in many areas, one aspect that could have been better is the music. Yuvan Shankar Raja, who has delivered iconic soundtracks in the past, falls just short of the high expectations set for him. The background score and songs, while not bad by any means, don't reach the heights one might hope for in a Venkat Prabhu film. However, this minor shortcoming does not detract too much from the overall experience. The music serves its purpose and complements the film, even if it isn't as memorable as some of Yuvan's previous work.Overall, Venkat Prabhu delivers a movie that is sure to entertain a wide range of audiences. The film is packed with engaging characters, an exceptional antagonist, and visuals that make it worth experiencing in theaters. Fans of the director and the genre will find plenty to enjoy, while even casual viewers will appreciate the high-quality production values and the tightly woven narrative. Despite some minor hiccups with the music, the film is an exciting and well-executed piece of entertainment that should not be missed. Whether you are a die-hard fan or someone looking for a fun theatrical experience, this film is definitely worth watching at least once.\n",

Following a botched mission in Thailand in 2008 , Gandhi goes into self imposed exile before he is called back in 2024 to deal with the repercussions of the failed mission along with an unlikely antagonist, a younger version of himself!!Loud music & over the top action scenes are the hallmark of the film giving the audience what it wants !ABT the performances... Vijay's double role as the father and son is decent except for the buffoonery shown in the guise of comedy in the first half. Putting comedy scenes in the middle of a serious action scene is extremely irritating & distracting . I have seen this happen even in a magnum opus like Kalki . Kyon yaarüò°üò°... Not neededüò°üò°.There are a couple of twists in the Storyline which are guessable yet well executed!! Watch out for Prabhu Deva in the film , a restrained performance for a change. Actions scenes have been decently showcased especially the Fights scenes between Vijay's older and younger version üëçüëçFirst half is the weak link , but the sceond half is gripping, though the final climax seemed a bit too streched. Again the story is nothing to boast about, been there, seen it a million times . Songs too seem unnecessarily inserted at times disrupting the narrative.

I will forever call this movie the worst of all time (woat ).Vijay has so many cringeworthy dialogues and scenes. He imitates so many actors and it's embarrassing. Dude. Do you no longer have your own style or mannerisms? He copies Rajini, of course. Then, Sivaji, Kamal, Prakash Raj, and Shahrukh. Ridiculous. Glad Vijay is retiring from films. He no longer has anything to offer but endless copying and cringe.Gandhi character was ok. But Jeevan character was so cheap - dialogues and all felt like b grade. As usual, heroines have nothing to do in a Vijay movie. Songs and BGM are a huge letdown.Was good to see Prasanth in a film after so long. He has done a good job. Prabhu Deva too. Mohan was miscast.

            "Review 30: This movie has moments every 20 minutes that keep you cheering.The story is interesting,, and the double action from Thalapathy Vijay is amazing. The runtime may be criticised, but personally, it didn't feel that lengthy. The plot twists and the songs are very good. The antagonist could have been more powerful but when you watch the movie, it makes sense on why he isn't. Yuvan Shankar Raj was criticised before the movie was released;; however, he has proven that he was the correct selection for this VP hero. His bgm elevates the movie as a whole, especially the post-credits scene which has you on edge. The interval and climax scenes are the highlight of this movie.Venkat Prabhu has proved to us on why Vijay sir is The Greatest of All Time when it comes to the acting, the dancing and the singing. It really is upsetting that he is leaving the industry to pursue politics, given the fact that he is at his peak.You should definitely give The Greatest of All Time a watch.\n",

            "Review 31: The film has got plot with surprisingly ironic yet unexpected scenes. But I think the songs were bad and there were several illogical scenes which influenced the movie such as Menon being alive still after the train blast and even Menon being alive is impossible.'whistle podu' was okay but the other two songs was bad. But the Bgm was nice. I wanted to give 7.5 out of 10 but the an option isn't there and the cameos was also bad of Sivakarthikeyan and Trisha were a. Bit uncessary. Overall Vijay's past films with Lokesh and Atlee were way more better. From Master to leo we have been good songs but we didn't get in this one I hope thalapathy 69 will be nice.\n",

            "Review 33: We currently have no data available on what happened to the legendary director who crafted a high octane action film like 'Mankatha'. While the recent release 'Maanadu' was a hit, 'The Greatest Of All Time' is a miss and undeniably a huge pile of mess.Thalapathy Vijay's much anticipated entry into TN politics stirring debates, GOAT had high expectations and Venkat Prabhu has let down everyone. I hope their trip to Russia and Thailand was worth it because they sure have fabricated a vacation into a screenplay that did not necessarily need it.Yuvan Shankar Raja'a music and Prabhu Deva's choreography make GOAT a bearable experience while Dhilip Subbarayan's stunt work deserves critical applause. Vijay himself has poured his heart and soul into this film, his triple appearance is definitely a treat to his fans but he could have curbed his acting. Overacting is a side effect of poor direction and again I blame Venkat Prabhu.The movie reeks of age old clich√©s, the father vs son trope is no longer emotional anymore and the characterization also doesn't leave much to be desired. Filler face Sneha, low class acting Laila, just for star value Prashant, annoying as usual Jayaram - Don't get me wrong - they are all fantastic actors but the script has ruined them.You can find yourself laughing during serious moments, and if you are fan of cinema, you can see 'twists' turning up from miles ahead. Premji is one character that I hated whole heartedly. Contrastingly, Trisha was a delight to see on screen, her first performing a solo dance number in her 20+ years of experience in the industry.The 40 minute climax was overly long and as audience, I was waiting for the movie to end. I am not a fan of Vijay but I like him and it's heartbreaking to realize that this disaster of a film could potentially be his last impression in the Tamil Cinema Industry.\n",

All money wasted, no logics, no good screenplay and mainly the same old story. Nothing new in this , just they have added more cameos to attract people more in the theaters. To the hype , this movie has vanished . The music and bgm is the worse didnt expect this from yuvan, there were songs which isnt relevant to the pace of the movie. It affects the movie. First half is much better than 2nd half. The love portion and the humour part was nice. VP can do only humour movies, he can continue that. Dont make garbages , i am so disappointed. Another positive is Vijay his acting and performances were soo good but to a poor directional blunt. To much load of casts which didnt even match the requirement of such charcterisation. Every scene and every thing happens suddenly for no reason, just a terrible screenplay overall. Overall aan average vijay movie, even the mass moments are low gor vijay, there was only one though. Please do watch it in theaters (if you can please dont watch) VP just made a mess of it, below average direction.\n",

            "The action sequences are thrown in just for the sake of adding masala, but they don't serve the story in any meaningful way. The choreography is lackluster, and instead of being high-octane, they feel painfully drawn out. The songs? Totally unnecessary. They disrupt the flow of the film and feel like they were added purely as filler to make the runtime unbearable. None of them are memorable or serve any purpose other than to test the audience's patience.2. Cringe-Worthy Cloning Effects\n",
            "In what is perhaps one of the most cringe-inducing parts of the film, the addition of Vijay duplicates at the end takes the cake for useless, outdated, and downright embarrassing special effects. The \"cloning\" gimmick might have been novel a decade ago, but here, it looks like something pulled out of the early 2000s and just thrown on screen with no thought. It's not impressive-it's ridiculous.3. Old-School, Outdated Execution\n",
            "The entire movie feels like it's stuck in a time warp. The fight scenes are outdated, the romantic subplots are stereotypical, and the comedic moments are just unfunny. The film seems to rely on tropes and clich√©s that might have worked 20 years ago but feel completely out of place in modern cinema.4. Unnecessary Masala\n",
            "Every time you think the film is going to move forward, it takes another detour to throw in more masala moments-forced hero worship, overdone slow-motion shots, and unrealistic stunts that completely disengage you from the narrative. The masala here doesn't spice things up-it just makes the movie feel overcooked and stale.5. Wasted Potential and Poor Direction\n",
            "It's clear that there was potential for a more gripping story, but the direction falters at every turn. Instead of focusing on character development or a cohesive plot, the film relies on old-school tricks, long-drawn-out scenes, and a barrage of pointless sequences that only serve to bloat the runtime.6. Not worth intro of SK and Trisha with songs, how does Vijaya knows SK name while he says \"Shiva\" so silly.Quite a lot of errors to list out..In short, *GoAT* feels like a tired retread of outdated concepts, with poorly executed action and cringe-inducing effects.

            "Review 41: #TheGoat, here's my take on itThe movie opens with an action scene holding the potential for a grand sequence and sprinkles mere glimpses of a veteran star through mediocrely de-aged visuals and then ends up only revealing the sub-par VFX work - taking us almost back to the treasured 'Kuruvi' days.As we begin forcing ourselves to overlook the middling, sparingly emerges a worthy enough yet short husband wife drama leading on to a nerve wrecking emotional segment. Better late than never, the much awaited take-off finds segway through grief. Although predictable, a handful of attempted twists and turns manages to maintain some grip.The moment in time, within the context of soon to retire big star, a bunch of well placed dialogues bring strong moments of nostalgia. Then comes a couple of amazingly curated and rightly placed cameos, quickly pacing into a goose bumping stretch packing back to back high-moments and a peak climax. Amidst all those little cardamoms and cloves, one may still come out relishing a tummy full moment after a biryani feast.Ash.\n",

            "Review 43: I wandered into this theater having only read their thumbnail description and figured that I'd have an okay time, despite the daunting three hour investment. Our pathetic audience of four could have played bridge. The others were very sedate throughout. We sat very far apart in the cavernous house. I did periodically peek in on them for reactions. They didn't seem to have a pulse. But I was having a high old time.It started on a high octane note. The lead, Gandhi, got himself on a high speed train through the middle of nowhere. He was securing a stolen sample of U-235, which the captions inform us could blow up to Hiroshima or Nagasaki levels. Needless to say, mission accomplished. There is so much thrilling action in just this scene with him and his anti terrorism colleagues. They all pose as Indian tourism workers as their job, a front which also keeps their adoring families in the dark. Given the amount of twists, turns and flashbacks, it would be exhausting to detail a review. The comedic scenes are hilarious and appear throughout. The dance numbers are lavish, overwrought spectacles. There is a fair amount of romance involving both leading men.For such a sprawling ensemble, it is by and large well cast. Gandhi's wife, played by Sneha Anusuya, is absolutely stunning and talented. I am unfamiliar with the lead, Joseph Vijay. He is a huge star in South Indian film and this is his penultimate film, though he is only fifty. He is incomprehensibly talented, charming and charismatic. I was constantly rooting for him, despite his increasingly poor survival chances. Rajiv Menon made a great villian in Mohan. The director, Venkat Prabhu, is obviously a patient and wise man with great taste. The outtakes during closing credits are hysterically funny and as entertaining as anything in the film itself. What a wonderful coda. At one point, Gandhi recreates the Mission Impossible theme song, which is a clever homage and cute way to implicitly break the fourth wall. This film's scope and breadth rivals that of RRR, which I saw with a house of 250 happy people. Unfortunately, this film will not find much of an American audience. Their Indian American audience base, enormous in my city, may have seen it on opening Saturday. It's the kind of movie that needs a significant audience for ideal engagement. They don't know what they're missing.\n",

            "Review 44: In the time where most of the big stars are taking ages to release their movies while piling up on new projects just for the hype you have to admire Thalapathy Vijay for consistently delivering one movie per year. His last 5 movies may have not been top-notch in all aspects but they have delivered some very good fan service and decent entertainment (probably except Varisu in my opinion).The Greatest of All Time aka G. O. A. T does exactly the same thing that it says in the title: Celebrate Vijay. The movie is a roller coaster ride which has both ups and downs in terms of script and also the making. Script may not be great but it has enough elements to provide the right entertainment. The movie slightly lags or disappoints because of the unnecessary goofiness and just above average visual effects. Although the movie does have some Venkat Prabhu signature elements of twists and double games it lacks the surprise elements. Most of the plot twists are very predictable and a chaotic screenplay doesn't help their cause. I was initially disappointed thinking the trailer may have revealed too much, but eventually certain parts of the trailer cut seem like a genius effort. The movie is not really great (or should I say the GOAT) with its technical departments. Action sequences don't feel refreshing and the iconfusing cinematography doesn't help its cause. The main BGM theme along with the rap song is amazing but it isn't used well enough and there are unnecessary placement of songs especially in the era where movies are evolving away from the same.Thalapathy Vijay definitely gives it all playing the main role(s). He has played a unique dual role and I cannot reveal more about it as it could be a spoiler. Unfortunately, his look with the de-aging technology probably takes away some of the greatest moments and makes them look more cringy. There are some scenes which probably only suit Vijay's style and it is kind of hard to imagine a different actor pulling those off. The movie also has some great supporting cast and some very special appearances (some of which have references beyond the movie). Prashanth and Sneha play really strong characters and both are excellent. Most of the supporting characters have decent roles except Meenakshi Chaudhary whose role is again a bit stereotypical eye candy at times. Premgi Amaren and Yogi Babu's comedy does work in most parts but feels predictable at times. Kokila Mohan as the antagonist adds a unique dimension but his role could have been written better.The Greatest of All Time tries to be both Thalapathy Vijay's trademark movie and Venkat Prabhu's at the same time and falls short on both aspects. It is definitely an entertainer if you don't think too much and it's a blast ;) for Vijay and CSK fans. The movie also does its bit to lay out the red carpet for Vijay's political journey.\n",

            "Review 45: \"GOAT - The Greatest of All Time\" is a film that, despite its ambitious title, falls short of expectations in almost every aspect. Directed by Vijay, the film seems to have aimed for a grand spectacle but ended up delivering a disappointing experience for the audience. While the movie does have a few redeeming qualities, such as the comedic timing of Yogi Babu and the acting prowess of Mohan, these elements are not enough to save it from its numerous flaws. Ultimately, \"GOAT\" stands as an unfortunate example of poor storytelling and weak execution in many critical areas.One of the film's most glaring issues is its lack of engaging content (GC). The narrative struggles to maintain a coherent and compelling storyline, leaving the audience disconnected from the plot. There seems to be a clear deficiency in the development of the characters and the overall direction of the movie. Rather than drawing viewers into a well-crafted story, the film meanders through scenes that feel disjointed and aimless, making it difficult for the audience to stay invested. This lack of substance is a key factor in why \"GOAT\" feels like a missed opportunity, despite the talent involved.The background music (BGM), which is typically a crucial element in setting the tone and enhancing the emotional depth of a film, is another major disappointment. In \"GOAT,\" the BGM fails to complement the scenes or elevate the dramatic moments. Instead of adding intensity or emotion, the music often feels out of place and, at times, distracts from the unfolding events. A well-crafted score can make or break a movie, and in this case, the lackluster BGM contributes to the overall sense of mediocrity.Additionally, the film's songs, which are often a highlight in Indian cinema, fall flat. None of the tracks manage to leave a lasting impression, and they seem hastily put together, lacking the lyrical or melodic appeal that one would expect from a film of this scale. In an industry where songs can sometimes define a movie's success, the forgettable music of \"GOAT\" is a clear indication of the film's failure to capture the audience's imagination.Perhaps the most critical flaw, however, lies in the screenplay. Written by Vijay and his team, the screenplay is riddled with problems that undermine the entire film. The pacing is erratic, with certain scenes dragging on unnecessarily while others feel rushed and underdeveloped. There are moments where the plot seems to go nowhere, leaving viewers confused about the direction of the story. The lack of cohesion in the screenplay makes it difficult to follow, and it's clear that more effort should have been put into crafting a narrative that is both engaging and logical.Mohan's performance is one of the few bright spots in \"GOAT.\" As a seasoned actor, he brings a level of gravitas to his role that helps anchor the film, even when the script fails him. His nuanced portrayal adds some depth to an otherwise shallow narrative, and his presence on screen is one of the few reasons why some audience members may still find moments of enjoyment in the film. Similarly, Yogi Babu's comedic scenes provide brief respites from the otherwise lackluster proceedings. His jokes land well, and his comedic timing adds some much-needed levity to the movie. However, relying on a few jokes to carry the film is not enough to make up for its other shortcomings.Vijay's decision to helm this project raises questions about his creative choices. It's evident that the story plot, penned by Vijay himself, is deeply flawed. The premise of the film had the potential to be something great, but the execution falls flat. The weak plot and poor direction result in a movie that feels like a chore to sit through, and it's hard not to be disappointed by the outcome.In conclusion, \"GOAT - The Greatest of All Time\" is far from living up to its title. While Mohan and Yogi Babu provide some moments of enjoyment, the film is ultimately let down by its lack of engaging content, poor background music, forgettable songs, and a deeply flawed screenplay. Vijay's decision to pursue this story was a misstep, and the movie stands as one of his weaker efforts. For a film with such high expectations, \"GOAT\" ends up being a disappointment on nearly all fronts.\n",

            "Review 49: Venkat Prabhu's latest film, often touted as the next big thing in South Indian cinema, featuring the legendary Vijay, has left many fans feeling deeply disappointed. Despite the buildup and anticipation surrounding \"GOAT,\" the movie fails to live up to its promise, delivering an underwhelming experience that raises questions about the direction of South Indian cinema and the larger aspirations of pan-Indian storytelling.From the outset, it's evident that \"GOAT\" was positioned as a blockbuster, designed to cater not just to Vijay's massive fanbase but to also make waves across India. The movie features an ensemble of big names, solidifying expectations that this would be a landmark film. Unfortunately, those expectations quickly unravel as the narrative progresses. The storyline, which should have been gripping and tightly woven, instead feels disjointed and often meandering, a far cry from the cohesive and compelling narratives we expect from pan-Indian productions.The Plot That Never Came TogetherThe most glaring issue with \"GOAT\" lies in its weak storytelling. While Venkat Prabhu has proven himself capable of helming engaging stories in the past, this time around, he seems to lose control of the narrative. The film meanders between subplots that never fully develop, leaving audiences confused and disengaged. For a movie that boasts such a massive star like Vijay, it's baffling how little his character is allowed to shine. The script doesn't give him the platform he deserves, especially for a film that claims to represent the \"Greatest of All Time.\"Moreover, the pacing is uneven. Certain scenes are dragged out unnecessarily, while others are rushed, with no room for character development or emotional investment. This lack of balance is a major flaw, making it hard to connect with the story or its characters.### Star-Studded Cast, But No SparksOne of the biggest talking points before the film's release was its stellar cast. Besides Vijay, the movie features numerous South Indian film industry heavyweights. Yet, despite this ensemble, the movie fails to harness the potential of its talent. What could have been powerful, dynamic performances end up feeling flat, largely because the characters are underwritten or relegated to the background.Vijay, who has a massive following and is known for his larger-than-life roles, is sorely underutilized. His fans, who flocked to see their hero in action, are left wanting more. The action sequences, while visually impressive in parts, lack the intensity and innovation that has come to define contemporary South Indian cinema. It's almost as if the film never finds its rhythm, oscillating between too much spectacle and not enough substance.### A Pan-Indian Film That Feels Too Local\"GOAT\" was marketed as a pan-Indian film, which is a growing trend as South Indian filmmakers aim to capture audiences across the country. However, Venkat Prabhu's execution of this vision falls short. The film lacks the universal appeal that makes a movie like \"Baahubali\" or \"KGF\" resonate beyond regional boundaries. The screenplay feels too rooted in local sensibilities, failing to bridge the gap to a broader audience. While it's important to retain cultural authenticity, there's a fine line between that and alienating viewers from other parts of the country.For a movie aspiring to reach a pan-Indian audience, the lack of a cohesive storyline and relatable characters severely limits its potential impact. The cinematography, while competent, also doesn't rise to the occasion, with scenes that could have been iconic feeling like missed opportunities. Venkat Prabhu's direction, which should have elevated the film, instead feels scattered and unsure.The Action That MisfiresSouth Indian cinema is known for its high-octane action sequences, but \"GOAT\" falls disappointingly short in this regard. The action, which should have been a highlight of the film, feels repetitive and uninspired. There are moments that could have been thrilling, but they're often overshadowed by poor choreography or illogical plot points. Given the talent involved, it's frustrating to see so many action sequences fall flat, devoid of the creativity and energy that audiences expect.A Plea for South Indian CinemaIn conclusion, \"GOAT\" is a significant letdown. Venkat Prabhu, a director who has shown great potential in the past, fails to deliver a compelling film, leaving both Vijay fans and cinema enthusiasts disappointed. The lack of a coherent storyline, underutilized star power, and lackluster action make this movie far from the pan-Indian spectacle it aspired to be.As South Indian filmmakers continue to expand their horizons, aiming for national and international recognition, there needs to be a greater focus on storytelling, character development, and precise execution. If the industry continues to churn out films that prioritize style over substance, it risks losing the momentum it has gained in recent years. Here's hoping that future projects can learn from the shortcomings of \"GOAT\" and truly deliver on the promise of great cinema.\n",

T an action thriller film written and directed by venkat prabhu who had previously directed custody which was also a dissappointing one the storyline of the goat is very routine and ordinary to say simply it revolves around gandhi and his teammates ( sunil, kalyan, Ajay ) who are the members of the special anti- terriost squad (SATS )headed by nazeer undergoes a mission in keneya years ago which makes serious issues in their personal years after years how gandhi and his teammtes faces and solves the issues form the rest of the story talking about the postives the first major postive is none other than thalapathy vijay his performance as both Gandhi and jeevan ( father and son ) was brilliant and especially during emotional sequences his performance was top notch and rather than performances he also scores in his usual areas such as action, dance homour etc he is the main pillar of the film other actors such as prashanth, prabhudeva, sneha, ajmal ameer, jayaram, laila, mohan, meenkshi choudary, yogi babu and venkat prabhu's usual artists have done their roles effectively no complaints but some of their characters are not properly written the next positive is the some of the homour sequences involving vijay and sneha, vijay and his teammates and vijay and yogi babu were worked well especially yogi babu's some of the comedies were hilarious the total first half barring the interval point was interesting with no drag moments and it is also a notable postive the next positive is the perfect de aging technic used for vijay's jeevan character prior release the de aging was heavily criticized but in the film it was convincing which had highly saved the film the screenplay by venkat prabhu was crisp and taut in some parts ( pre interval and climax sequences )which is also a postive but also screenplay was highly predictable during some of the scenes the twists and turns in the movie also worked in some parts and it was also predictable in many scenes the easter eggs and the surprising cameos were interesting and entertaining but did not jell with the storyline and also not created a strong impact the background score by yuvanshankar raja was not great but still it was not worst too it was a good one and elevated some of the average scenes to some extent which is also a big positive the jeevan character was written in an effective way and becomes a memorable one than that of the Gandhi 's character the climax sequences was also very good and writing by venkat prabhu was very good on some parts of the movie which is also a positive thing coming to the negatives of the film the first main negative was it's very routine ordinary and generic storyline the story highly resembled vijayakanth 's film rajadurai which was directed by vijay's father sa chandrasekar and Also some of the old commercial tamil films the screenplay as mentioned above was good in some parts but in major parts it fumbles and becomes highly predictable and the twist and turns also become highly prediticable especially in interval and post interval scenes because of weak writing also the characters other than vijay are weakly written especially female characters were highly pathetic and antangoinst role by mohan were highly underwhelming even through mohan's performance was good also the deaging for the character jeevan was good but it also become worst in the post interval scenes where jeevan character was shown much more younger also the other vfx and graphics was also very creepy and looked highly artificial the songs and the placement of them were highly tertible and highly affected the flow of the film especially the song placements of spark and matta were the major drawbacks also the most shocking disappointment was the technical side 's inefficiency cinemotagraphy by siddharata nuni who had done great camera work in vendu thanithathu kadu and capital miller was highly erratic especially in the bangtok sequences and editing was also very narrow and uneven and most surprisingly the action sequences by dhilip subbarayan who had done a brillant work in valimai was highly underwhelming in this movie except the terrific bike chase featuring both vijays in Russia all the other action sequences were not convincing and illogical especially the intro train fight metro fight and even climax too and the tribute they gaven to the late captain vijayakanth in AI was highly shoddy and they would have even avoided this rather than giving a legend a lathergic tribute like this and also Easter eggs which was entertaining beccomes irritating when it becomes over dosage to conclude goat is not the greatest of all time in both vijay and venkat prabhu's career but still it is good despite major flaws effective writing and high technical brillance would have made the film to justify its title overall a partially entertaining commercial potboiler far better than vijay and venkat prabhu's previous outings which will be a delightful watch for his fans and a decent watch for others worth one time watchable in theatre postives : thalapathy vijay's screenpresence and performance, homour portions, jeevan's character arch

Deaging in the movie was at its best compared to the one in the songs.supporting characters were given good roles especially prashant and sneha and prabu deva..cameo by lead actors was excellently placed and well done..Thala reference and CSK match with BGM was goosebumps moment for everyone..A Massive success for Thalapathy and Team..\n",

            "Review 52: This movie was a complete disaster-a true waste of time. Not only did it fail to entertain, but it also left me frustrated, as if the script had been written by a child with no regard for the audience's intelligence. The filmmakers seemed to be treating viewers like children, offering a painfully convoluted and shallow story.Over-the-Top Acting\n",
            "Vijay's performance was a major letdown. His acting was overly exaggerated and hyperactive, making it hard to take any scene seriously. It felt like he was constantly trying too hard to sell jokes that just didn't land. Most of the humor relied on throwbacks, as if the film was banking on pure nostalgia to generate laughs, which only added to the sense of laziness.Uncomfortable Age Gap and Gender Representation\n",
            "The romantic subplot was particularly cringeworthy, with an uncomfortable 25-year age gap between the lead actor and the girl. It was nauseating to watch. To make matters worse, the women in the movie were treated as mere props, with no real roles or depth beyond standing in the background of scenes.Sloppy Action Sequences\n",
            "The fight scenes were terribly choreographed, dragging on far too long and lacking any sense of realism or excitement. It was reminiscent of two children play-fighting while making cartoonish \"dhishum dhishum\" sound effects. It reminded me of the disastrous Race 3, another film notorious for its poorly executed action sequences and convoluted story.Conclusion\n",
            "Overall, this movie felt like a lazy vijay fan service, relying on recycled jokes and tired tropes to draw in audiences. The acting was exaggerated, the plot was childish, and the action scenes were laughably bad. It was an experience I wouldn't wish on anyone, and I left the theater wishing I had spent my time elsewhere.\n",

            "Review 54: Thalapathy Vijay delivers a powerhouse performance in \"The Greatest of All Time\" (2024), showcasing his acting prowess and screen presence. The film keeps you guessing with its suspenseful plot, and the screenplay lays a solid foundation for the story.However, the movie falls short of being truly captivating. Some scenes and dialogues feel lackluster, and the pacing struggles to maintain consistent engagement. While certain moments shine, others leave you wanting more.Overall, \"The Greatest of All Time\" is a decent action film elevated by Vijay's performance and a suspenseful narrative. It may not be a masterpiece, but it's worth watching for fans of the actor and those seeking a suspenseful thriller. Just be prepared for some uneven moments along the way.\n",

            "Review 55: The reason for the 10 stars is how this movie has served to be a proper commercial movie that entertains people who watch it in theatres.People may have a difference of opinion with this, but the the way Venkat Prabhu's screenplay and his effective direction comes into play is really amazing. He has managed to easily pull in one of the best commercial cinemas ever made. Master was the one which hit the sweet spots of commercial cinema back in 2021, but GOAT has to be the best after Master easily.A SATS agent named Gandhi, with his family goes to Thailand, till that you'll get Varisu kind of vibes because of the mannerisms of Vijay. But after the conflict point, the film picks pace and the entire narration becomes different. Fast paced action sequences, made the first half passable.The second half of the movie is where things get interesting with surprise cameos and classic twists that a commercial cinema would have. Though a couple of them were predictable, it was fun to know what happens and then realise what ee expected happened. That was really good. The acting variation between old Vijay and the younger one was clearly visible and that was really good to see from Vijay as a performer. Other than that, Prashanth, Prabhu Deva, Ajmal and everyone were needed for the story and none of the characters felt useless. The action sequences were top notch as well. The choreography was too good and even though the songs were not the best og Yuvan, the BGMs were phenomenal.Now, let's come to the negatives. The de-aging. That is the only negative thing. The youngest version of Vijay looked pathetic and helpless because of the poor VFX. The post teenage version (spark song one) was reworked and that looked better actually. Yes, there were some lags but the racy screenplay made it forget those things. Other than that there were no much negatives to say.Overall, it's a worthy entertainer. Ignore the fully negative reviews. I watched this without any expectations and it was a really great movie. Do watch in theatres!\n",

            "Review 56: 400 crore budget, yeah Vijay was paid 200 crores, but damn. The VFX, after the team promoting it so much as high quality, there was so much green screen it was unbelievable. The whole de-aging thing was meh at best for Captain Vijayakanth that is, but still the AI generated expressions were so terrible, even worse for the 16 year old version of thalapathy.Coming to the storyline, and script, in general it was very predictable, like what you can gather from the trailer is exactly what the film is. The comedy worked in some places, mainly when Yogi Babu came in the second half, and a few counters from Vijay and Premgi. The runtime being 3 hours, was so unnecessary, and the placements of the songs were in the most bizzare scenes, especially the 'spark' song. The BGM was just so loud and messy at times I don't even know what U1 was trying to do. In the climax, bro just gave up and let the CSK match commentary do the work üíÄ.In terms of performances, Vijay carried, as always, particularly the 'Illayathalapathy' character, and we were able to see some different acting and mannerisms from Vijay, although the villainism was quite goofy in several instances to be completely honest. As to everyone else, they were decent, nothing extraordinary.The action sequences were just constant shaky cam, and the choreography itself was basic. Basically, the film relied HEAVILY on fan service, and sure the cameos did work and the multitude of references to previous Vijay films and even Venkat Prabhu films.But overall, the film is just for the fans really, and the general audience will probably find this terrible unfortunately.\n",

Don't why have other songs moreover they place the songs at wrong timing.Top Star Prasant is good actor, not use properly same goes to Prabu Deva.Comedy totally not worked except Yogi Babu scenes.

            "Review 58: A movie with loads of expectations - supposed to be VP's multi cast commercial entertainer, surprise cameos, 90s stars comeback, rich production, use of Deaging, Vijay's penultimate film before official political entry etc.Synopsis: Movie starts with Gandhi alongside his colleagues/friends, part of anti-terrorist squad in 2008 doing a string operation in Kenya, kills big fish Menon. Their families not aware of their real job. Gandhi goes for vacation with family where loses his son in accident when enemies kidnap him. Wife leaves Gandhi with new born daughter. 15 years later, Gandhi away from squad for long, seperated from wife but visits daughter often, been in touch with squad friends too. Later he been invited to train young squad alongside reopening squad branch in Russia. Gandhi travels to Russia with squad lead Nazeer where attack been made by Russian protestors where he shockingly meets his once dead son Jeevan alive grown up and part of the mafia. Gandhi returns with Jeevan to India, spends time happily, fall in love with Sunil's daughter, later Gandhi and colleagues face threats, family attacks from Villain Menon who comesback alive. Things worse when bomb attack planned during IPL in Chennai leading to Big chases, actions and whether Gandhi/Squad wins or not is the climax.Positives: Vijay as Gandhi steals the show. In recent films his looks, swag and Screenpresence are extraordinary. Carries film throughout. Prashanth, PrabhuDeva have very good roles as Vijay's friends. Jayaram, Sneha, Laila, Ajmal, Mohan all with their limited screentimes excelled really well. Very happy to see the 90s stars together onscreen and felt nostalgic. Few surprise camoes too. Yogi Babu in his 5-10 mins make us laugh. Much criticised one before movie release was the music, but Yuvan did a fare job indeed with good song numbers and decent bgm (may be not great like other VP + Yuvan combo films, still good). Songs choreography were great as well.Negatives: Issue is with movie plot. Nothing new, cliche in most parts, unnecessary song placements and bad pacing of first half. Intro action scene itself was bad, then cringey scenes in name of family/friends fun, entire first half unable to realise if its a serious movie or spoof. Somehow film picks up in 2nd half. As usual over the top actions, yawnful climax, all these for a regular revenge story.Mohan as Menon performed well but impact wasn't great as Villain. Vijay as Jeevan was so cringey, reminded his role in ATM. Though individual performances are good, yet another Kollywood big movie let down by poor writing , Lengthy too (3 hrs).Deaging in fresh attempt in thamizh movies can be applaudable but not at all required for this plot. Used for Vjkanth role in name of tribute, then for young Vijay. Both looked pathetic and 0 impact unfortunately. Instead, this budget could have been better utilised in other stuffs and making.Guess VP and movie team solely dependant on Thalapathy stardom and the 90s cast. Just One time watchable for the same. Time and again disappointing that proven directors in kollywood can't pull of a Pan India blockbuster or Regional critic successful hit recent times with big thamizh heroes and big production. An average commercial Flick 6.2/10, only for the starcast and performances.\n",

            "Review 59: The movie struggles to rise above mediocrity due to its poor execution and ineffective narrative structure. The pacing feels uneven, and there is a noticeable lack of tension or curiosity to draw the audience in. As a result, the film feels disjointed and fails to sustain viewer engagement throughout its runtime. The storytelling lacks emotional depth, offering no significant moments that resonate or leave a lasting impression.The visual effects, which could have been a saving grace, are underwhelming and do little to enhance the experience. Instead, they feel generic and poorly integrated, further diminishing the film's appeal. The director appears to have relied heavily on references and homages, but without a solid script to back them up, these efforts come across as shallow and uninspired. This lack of originality and creative direction is the movie's greatest shortcoming.For fans of the lead actor, the film might offer a few moments of solace, but it's clear that this is not the strong, compelling performance they were hoping for. The unfortunate reality is that the movie fails to deliver on its promise and falls short of expectations, leaving even the most loyal fans struggling to find reasons to celebrate it.\n",

Later on how that mission creates an impact on his personal life is all about the movie.If anyone who has watched spy action movies a lot , GOAT doesn't provide anything new.This movie is a pakka VIJAY movie with his dance, with his usual naughtiness, with his style action, his references from his previous movies and all that. Once again it's fully on Vijay's shoulder to carry such a not so great story making it a watchable factor.The majority of the artists like Laila , Jayaram , Sneha , Meenakshi, Ajmal , Prabudeva , VTV Ganesh, Venkat Prabhu's fixed actors in his earlier movies didn't have any impactful performance.The 1st half goes on a fast pact ,the only high moment for me was the bike chase sequence at Moscow. The interval block was predictable.The second half again twists and turns but also there were some situations of questions such as how this character all of a sudden came into picture, how this thing happened which was one of the drawbacks.Yuvan music was pathetic. Whistle Podu song which was enjoyed by hearing on YouTube but what last minute changes made thereby spoiled the mood.De aging was good but turned out to worst when they portrayed the youngest VIJAY.Climax portion with SivaKarthikeyan cameo, music of Mankatha was awesome.END CREDITS gives hopes of Thalapathy rethinking his decision of quitting films.Overall , GOAT delivers what you expect from a Vijay Film but doesn't deliver what a film lover wants.\n",

It has its moments and they did their best with the budget they had, Venkat Prabhu definitely made another creative storyline that suits Vijay. Him living a double life as a family man and spy agent is a unique thing for the south indian cinema, VP certainly pulled it off right. I really liked the Vijay double acting as Jeevan the son and Gandhi the father, both of them are very different characters and don't feel like they're played by the same exact person. Interval was amazing with the first half setting up the bigger story and the second half being a thriller and action sequence. Even though the de-aging looked a bit off, it can be excused as its not a big problem, Vijay's performance was in my opinion very raw and natural, which is why he's at the top of Indian actors. Prabhu Deva and Prashanth being the two side characters and friends was also nice, seeing Prashanth back after a long time was a treat. Yuvan Shankar Raja didn't really make good songs, but his background score makes up for it, Mohan as the villain was also weird but the performance he gave was superb, he wasn't really much of a fight villain but rather a villain who uses their brains to beat the main hero, the plot twists were very nice and felt unpredictable. Overall, superb acting and direction, plot is decent and music is also not that great, YSR could have been replaced by Anirudh, it would have fit this film.\n",

            "Review 76: \" GOAT \" promises an intense, edge-of-the-seat experience but ultimately fails to deliver. Despite the slick production values and stylish promotions, the movie stumbles in crucial aspects, making it a forgettable watch.One of the biggest downfalls of \"GOAT\" is its reliance on style over substance. The director seems more focused on presenting cool moments and visual gimmicks rather than developing a meaningful story. It feels like the filmmakers forgot that a good movie requires more than just a glossy exterior; it needs heart, nuance, and a compelling narrative.The film's runtime, too, is unnecessarily stretched, making it a patience-testing affair. The climax, which should have been the film's high point, ends up being predictable and unconvincing, leaving the audience underwhelmed.Vijay despite his efforts, is bogged down by poorly written dialogues and a lackluster character arc. Supporting actors, too, are given little to do, with most characters reduced to mere caricatures. Even seasoned actors are wasted in roles that don't require their caliber.In conclusion, \"GOAT\" had the potential to be a solid entertainer but is marred by its lack of focus, over-reliance on gimmicks, and a hollow script. It's a visually appealing but emotionally empty experience, leaving viewers craving for more depth and genuine storytelling. If you're looking for style with little substance, \"GOAT\" might be worth a watch, but if you seek a well-rounded film, this one might not be for you.\n",

            "Review 77: You shouldn't be expecting a logic in a commercial movie especially when it is big hero movie. But still the logic is a big miss in Goat on several occasions. Goat is the worst VP movie not considering (Manmatha Leelai and Custody). VP failed big in writing and rather took the run time with too much reference, cameos and nostalgic moments. Vijay deserved better penultimate movie. This movie is not a theatre material, can be a tough/time pass watch in OTT. Cricket stadium scenes looked like a spoof with full of nonsensical scenes. Poor visuals , VFX , Music, Songs. Negative role done by Vijay didn't give any impact. Vijay as Gandhi did well, other than that nothing good in this illogical cringefest .Greatest of All Time - Greatness can't be defined if the word just added in the title.\n",

Vijay is the show stealer as a Father and son,he proved that he can do negative shade. Mohan character could have wrote better as a senior actor his character is very limited. Prashant and other characters are well utilizes. Surprise Cameo was really good and not even bored. Matta song was just awesome in theatre. Action scenes are well made, especially interval block and climax was mind-blowing. Climax Thala reference was completely shock when Mangatha music came scene was goosebumps. A perfect theatre material we can watch with family.\n",

Other scenes were great. - 3/10.Speed was overall good, but some parts were too dragged too fast. - 4.5/10Overall, a must watch movie with a great balance of action. Thrill, romance and emotion.

It could've been better if that outline was handled by a suitable screenplay. VP did magic in representing young Vijay with the old one. It worked well. Yuvan BGM was not engaging. It sounds as if it was scored for a namesake. Two songs were good there which were a dance number in the highlight. VJ holds the whole flick with his charisma.

It feels like a turbulent flight with many twists but not working and very predictable. Inclusion of many characters which were not needed. It felt more a spoof than a real movie. Music of this movie doesn't feel good enough. Background scores are somewhat good in some scenes. The movie is so long with moderate content although some of the supporting cast were good and justified their characters. Makeup and some scenes with AI made it more like spoof.

There are so many capable actors out there cmon.random and unnecessary graphical parts.simple details like how characters are shown to age or how the timing of how one character shows up in another location, is all poorly thought out as it is highly illogical. We see jayaram as team leader to vijay and 3 others, however 16 years later the team members have all aged and greyed beyond jayaram, while jayaram has had no visual modificationsüòêit just seemed poorly thought out.-spoiler** (and that LAST end-credit thing?? What?? Makes absolutely no relevancy or sense to the entire 3 hours I already wasted).I can go on and on, but honestly it was a sad and embarassing movie to be THE last movie of thalapathy. His acting was so disappointing, and as nostalgic viewers gathered to watch his last onscreen show, we would've wanted to see more authentic acting and raw conveyance of emotions, rather than a whole load of whatever that was (sorry). Sometimes (most times) big budget really doesn't mean \"better\".Venkat Prabhu, you not only did NOT do this movie justice, I think it brought down Vijay's years-long repertoire thus far, as I truly believe this is the worst film in his entire careerüíîüíî\n",

            "\"GOAT\" tries to establish itself as a gripping thriller, but unfortunately, it ends up more like a timid lamb in the grand arena of Tamil cinema. The protagonist, meant to symbolize the \"Greatest of All Time\" (GOAT), embarks on a mission of vengeance, wrapped in mystery and betrayal. The story follows the familiar thriller path of personal loss, revenge, and dark conspiracies, but it struggles to live up to the metaphor of being the GOAT.Review:\n",
            "The term GOAT carries immense weight-just like how we call Messi the GOAT for his unmatched prowess, this movie fails to deliver that same kind of excellence. Instead of being a standout thriller that grips you with every twist and turn, \"GOAT\" falters with a weak plotline and underwhelming character development. The pacing drags, and what could have been a riveting exploration of human grit and determination turns into a predictable affair.Despite the director's efforts to create tension, much of the film feels clich√©d, with over-the-top sequences and melodramatic moments that reduce its impact. The hero's journey feels forced, and the script doesn't provide enough depth to justify the \"GOAT\" title. A few interesting moments do exist, but they are too few and far between to save the movie from mediocrity.Positives:A couple of well-executed action sequences\n",

Vijay is my favourite tamil actor but this wasn't it. The music wasnt great and felt outdated. The first half i was actually interested highlighted by performances by Vijay and Sneha, it had a good amount of action humour and emotions. 2nd half is where it starts to take a major step back. The de aging didnt look bad but a lot of the background CGI was subpar. The deaged Vijay seemed just a bit too goofy and was leaning towards being jus excessive and overperformative. Scenes that should be serious and emotional would turn into this awkward try at humour. The ending felt weirdly rushed and stretched at the same time.

Whistle podu song was another disappointment, watching Prabhudeva and prashant dance next to Vijay and Vijay steps are not as much as his early songs like Thanjavur Jillakari or Appadi Podu. The return of Trisha in Matte song was like Gilli again. But these are all the fireworks.The 2nd Half was not connecting well with the first half l.

Additionally, a few plot twists feel somewhat predictable, taking away from the film's overall impact.Overall, \"Goat\" is a compelling and intense film that's sure to keep viewers engaged. With strong performances, impressive technical aspects, and thought-provoking themes, it's a must-watch for fans of the genre. While it's not perfect, the film's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses, earning it a solid 8/10 rating.Rating Breakdown:Story: 8/10Acting: 9/10Technical Aspects: 8.5/10Pacing: 7/10Overall: 8/10.\n",

            "Review 107: Goat 2024 by Vijay is truly one of the best movies I've seen exploring the deep and emotional bond between a father and son. The story navigates the complexities of their relationship with raw intensity, while also offering moments of tenderness that feel genuine and heartfelt. Vijay delivers a powerful performance, capturing the nuances of love, conflict, and reconciliation.What really stands out is how the movie tackles family dynamics in a way that's relatable yet profound. There's more to the film than just a father-son story, but to reveal more would take away from the experience. Trust me, it's worth watching and savoring every twist. And the last climax? Absolutely lit! It ties everything together in such a gripping way, making it an unforgettable end to an already remarkable film.\n",

            "Review 108: \"Greatest of All Time\" marks one of the most disappointing films in Vijay's illustrious career. Known for his ability to carry even weak scripts with his charm, energy, and screen presence, this time, even Vijay's star power fails to rescue a film that lacks coherence, purpose, and direction.Vijay tries hard, delivering his typical energetic performance, but even his charisma can't save this sinking ship. The film's biggest flaw is its poor screenplay. The pacing drags in parts, with unnecessary songs and scenes that add no value to the story. The action sequences, though stylishly shot, feel repetitive and unexciting. There's a glaring lack of innovation or creativity, which only adds to the film's underwhelming nature.Overall, \"Greatest of All Time\" is a major letdown in Vijay's otherwise stellar career. It feels like a movie that was made to cash in on his star status, without paying attention to the quality of the content. It's hard to recommend this film even to die-hard Vijay fans, who deserve much better from their favorite actor.\n",

            "Review 110: **Goat Movie Review**\"Goat\" is, unfortunately, one of the most disappointing South Indian movies I've seen in recent times. From the lack of logic to the absence of a coherent storyline, this film is a mess from start to finish. The plot makes little sense, leaving the audience questioning every scene, and the SATS officer, a central character, is portrayed as a complete dumbass, which is both frustrating and unrealistic.The movie starts off on a promising note, with a few engaging scenes and some decent action sequences, but that's where the positives end. As soon as the initial excitement fades, it becomes clear that there's nothing to look forward to. The lack of suspense and poor pacing make it feel more like a cheap school play rather than a big-budget production.Ultimately, \"Goat\" is a complete waste of time. It tries to pass off a few fight scenes as entertainment, but without a meaningful storyline or any gripping moments, it fails miserably. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.\n",

If I could file legal case against the makers of this movie, especially the director, for wasting my two hours I would do that. I mean, does he take us for no brainers Or is he one himself glorified in Vijay wrap paper! It's such a shame this film, especially one that's supposed to give Vijay his grand exit. Yes, I enjoyed the Easter eggs but goodness, what a waste of a movie. More so, an insult to human intelligence and emotions. And catching MSDs eye roll was heights.

It was not distinctive in any way. I know this was done on purpose for the fans, but it really did not measure up to the expectations I had for the film. It was like watching the same thing we have been seeing for years-the same sentiments, jokes, and punch lines. With this film, Venkat Prabhu has truly let us down after directing such a fantastic film as Manadu. At best, the plot was mediocre. The de aging process was pitiful.The music was very loud. Vijay's popularity is the only explanation for why this film is able to run. With the acting, he has really excelled. It is obvious that this is a one-man performance because he spends the entire picture carrying the movie on his back. The story's writing is dreadful. It seemed just like three hours of nonstop reel watching. The scenes have no connection at all. One strange event after another just keeps happening. Lacks a meaningful backstory. The villain was a poor choice. I wish they had chosen someone with a stronger sense of self.\n",

Fantastic actor and dancer!The villain who's played by Mohan, he's really good but his character kinda gave me the vibes of the villain from Beast!

But Meenakshi looked so hot in that song. And the very beautiful, talented and insanely gorgeous beauty Trisha ma'am's cameo in the song Matta, Such a beauty she is!!The only question that's on my mind is how the makers will do a sequel of the film which is announced towards the end of the movie when Thalapathy Vijay sir has announced his retirement from the film industry! The sequel is most likely impossible to even happen!But GOAT is a well made entertaining movie!! Loved it totally!!\n",

            "Review 123: A movie that minted money at the box office but received a barrage of negative reviews. I had zero expectations going in and watched it just to see how bad it could be. The very first scene of the movie gives you the answer.An agent and his team from the Special Anti-Terrorism Squad undertake a mission, killing everyone involved. This leads to a disruption in his life, as his son dies as a result, and he retreats to a quiet, ordinary life-only to find himself once again facing the wrath of those connected to the mission he completed.You can't review the story because, sadly, the makers seem to have forgotten to write one. They stitched random scenes together and called it a movie. If you look for logic here, you'll only have yourself to blame. The film throws twists at you from many angles, most of which you can guess from miles away, though a few unexpected turns do work.This movie is solely made to worship Vijay. He is in literally every scene. You grow tired of seeing him, especially when he plays the younger version of himself, which feels outdated. Prabhudeva delivers in terms of acting and looks, while Prasanth is decent but not fit, making him almost unrecognizable. Sneha is good in her small role, but Meenakshi Chaudhary, used merely as eye candy, doesn't fit the part either as an actor or as eye candy. Jayaram and Yogi Babu are completely wasted in this mess, and the series of cameos adds no value.The whole technical expertise seems to have been focused on de-aging Vijay, which turned caricaturish and made him a laughing stock. There are plenty of action scenes, some decent, but the sheer number of them diminishes their impact. The songs are terrible, and the choreography, aside from the recreation of the \"Ghilli\" step with Trisha, is disappointing. There's literally a scene where an actress asks why she's been called, and the answer is: \"For a song.\" The scene abruptly breaks into a dance number, ending it with no connection to the previous scene. Even the VFX work is poor, especially the entire fight sequence on the stadium roof during the climax.At one point, they use the Mission Impossible BGM, and it's clear they attempted to copy the stunts but failed miserably. With a headache-inducing runtime of 3 hours, this movie isn't worth a dime. There's no good reason to endure this torture called The GOAT.

Though I am not a tamil speaking guy, I knew this point watching the trailer itself. No other promotions or interviews. Audience (myself) might definitely feel the movie dragged in such revealing scenes. For almost all the reveals, I was like \"Yeah, young thalapathy, I can see him, why hide, skip. Skip. SKIP.\" It would had been atleast good if BGM was set to elevate tense mood. Leave about bgm in family moments, it really does not sync in there. Finally, the VFX.

Gandhi's SATS team constitutes of Sunil Thiagarajan (Prashanth), Kalyan Sundaram (Prabhudeva), Ajay (Ajmal Ameer) and their boss Nazeer (Jayaram). On a work-cation trip to Thailand, an unpleasant incident changes his life and his approach to work. Cut to 17 years, Gandhi is now an immigration officer, who spends his days stamping passports, and taking care of his daughter who lives with his wife. The couple are separated. On a work trip to Russia, Gandhi accidentally meets his long-long son Jeevan, a young Vijay. And thus begins a cat-and-mouse game.\n",

            "Almost perfect-The GREATEST OF ALL TIME\"THe GOAT\" is a movie that left me with good feelings. On one hand, it was packed with action, drama, and various subplots, all happening simultaneously. However, on the other hand, the ending was rather straightforward and predictable. Furthermore, the film's length and inclusion of some unnecessary scenes made it feel a bit exhausting at times. In many ways, it adhered closely to the typical formula of a Tamil mass movie.One aspect of \"THe GOAT\" that truly stood out was its remarkable cinematography. The visuals were nothing short of spectacular, with breathtaking shots and stunning scenery that captivated the audience throughout the film. The use of modern technology in the production added a contemporary touch, making the movie feel relevant and in tune with the times. It was evident that the filmmakers had invested a considerable amount of effort and resources into crafting a visually stunning experience.The casting for \"THe GOAT \" was another highlight for me. The ensemble of actors brought their A-game to the table, delivering compelling performances that resonated with the audience. The chemistry between the cast members felt genuine, and their portrayals of their respective characters were convincing. It's not often that you find a movie where you can genuinely appreciate all the casting choices, but managed to achieve just that.Now, despite these positive aspects, there were some notable downsides to the film. As mentioned earlier, the sheer length of the movie was a bit daunting. At times, it felt like certain scenes were included for the sake of prolonging the runtime rather than adding significant value to the storyline. This made the viewing experience a bit tedious, and I found myself wishing for a more concise narrative.Additionally, the plot of THe GOAT followed a rather predictable trajectory. It adhered closely to the conventions of a typical Tamil mass movie, complete with the hero's journey, action-packed sequences, and larger-than-life villains. While this formula has its merits and can be enjoyable, it does run the risk of feeling formulaic. I would have appreciated a bit more innovation or a fresh perspective on this genre.However, despite these shortcomings, \"THe GOAT\" managed to keep me engaged primarily due to its impressive visuals and the cast's stellar performances. The action sequences were adrenaline-pumping, and the emotional moments were heartfelt. The film did evoke a sense of nostalgia for fans of the genre, as it paid homage to the classic elements that have defined Tamil mass cinema over the years.In conclusion, \"THe GOAT\" is a film that falls somewhere in between. While it may not break new ground in terms of storytelling or genre conventions, it compensates for this with its stunning cinematography and outstanding cast. If you're a fan of Tamil mass movies and can overlook a somewhat lengthy runtime and predictable plot, you'll likely find \"THe GOAT\" to be an enjoyable cinematic experience. For me, it earns a solid 9/10 rating, thanks to its visual brilliance and strong performances.\n",

Got to see a few old good actors again. Action scenes were not too bad though. But again jumping (oops flying with a bike) and jumping out of a burning train was all the same old boring story. The story was not bad . I wonder when is Vijay going tp do realistic movie other than saving someone, which he started since Gilli. Whole story was easily guessable. The movie was typically made to showcase heroism of Vijay. That's it. Waiting for a new heroic movie from the hero again.\n",

            "Review 147: I consider myself someone who can sit through even the worst films, but this movie tested every ounce of that resilience. From the very beginning, it became a GOAT-level disaster that I simply couldn't bear. Despite my efforts to fast-forward through the worst parts, even that didn't help, and halfway through, I had to give up. The film left me with an actual headache, which is rare for me.To put it mildly, the visual effects (VFX) are atrocious-unbelievably poor for modern standards. The screenplay felt like it was patched together last minute, with zero flow or coherence. Add to that the equally bad acting, and you have a recipe for disaster. Every scene was either cringeworthy or felt out of place.In summary, this is, without a doubt, one of the greatest flops of all time. Do yourself a favor and avoid it. Watch something like Ninja Hattori instead, which, despite its quirks, would be a much more entertaining experience compared to this.\n",

Vijay's performance truly shines-he brings a perfect mix of charisma, intensity, and heartfelt emotion to every scene, reminding us why he's hailed as 'Thalapathy.' The storyline is gripping from start to finish, with the perfect balance of action, drama, and suspense that keeps you hooked. The direction and cinematography were absolutely brilliant, capturing every moment with artistic precision. The supporting cast did an amazing job, and the soundtrack was powerful, heightening the emotions of every key scene. *Greatest of All Time* is not just a movie; it's an experience.

            "Review 149: This movie is about Gandhi, a Special Anti-Terrorism Squad (SATS) Agent who goes on a mission undercover with his family on vacation. The turns of events made him quit SATS and live an ordinary life. Years after his past comes to take revenge on him and his fellow SATS Agents.The movie has the potential to be made as a great action thriller, but Venkat Prabhu didn't write a compelling story with proper scenes, twists, and turns. The movie heavily resembles \"Gemini Man\" in outline. The movie runs for 3 hours, which is too long duration to tell this movie, but it is engaging most of the time. The fight sequences seem good. The main villain, Menon, is not written well enough because he is not as intimidating as Sanjay. There are more flaws to tell about this film, but I couldn't remember things much from it, which proves how lame this movie was.After \"Maanaadu (2021)\", I had expectations of Venkat Prabhu to give another good entertainer but was let down by this movie. He should worked more on the script instead of trying to place cameos and references to his and Vijay's previous films, etc. Vijay did a great job in the character 'Jeevan', and it was the only comforting thing in the movie. Other artists did justice to their roles even though they had no scope in character to show their excellence. The background music was mediocre; I didn't expect this from Yuvan Shanker Raja (He did a good job in 'Maanaadu', even in 'Garudan'). The songs were lame too. The De-aging looks unnecessary as the output is poor in the film; instead, they cast Vijay's son for his younger role in the flashback scene, which could been a useful cameo.In conclusion, I didn't like this movie much, but if you want to watch this movie despite the flaws, then okay, don't expect it to entertain you well.\n",

            "Review 150: Actor Vijay Joseph tries to recreate the mystique of Rajnikanth type plot, but fails miserably. All the standard pot boiler ingredients are added. Lookalike of Vijayakanth, political messages (he is reported to be starting a political party to spite ruling anti Sanatan Dharma), zero presence of actresses, impossible stunts. Sitting through the film for 3 long hours became an ordeal.Perhaps, this appeals more to hysterical fans who destroy theatre properties on the first day, first show. Where are are Tamil movies heading towards. The make up of old and young Vijay looks unconvincing. The permanent disheveled hair look is irritating. As usual these larger than life movies try to keep a window for a sequel. I will surely avoid that dose of masochism.\n",

The movie's strength lies in its performances, particularly by Prashanth, who brings depth to his character. Vijayakanth's presence adds excitement, but unfortunately, both their CGI-enhanced younger versions are a major letdown. The graphics feel outdated and awkward, disrupting the flow in key scenes.Despite these technical issues, \"The Greatest of All Time\" still manages to provide solid entertainment. The predictable plot won't blow you away, and the visual effects could have been much better, but it's the strong performances and emotional moments that keep the film afloat. For casual viewers looking for a fun, feel-good experience, this movie does the job.It may not be groundbreaking, but \"The Greatest of All Time\" is a one-time must-watch for fans of Tamil cinema and those who enjoy light, engaging entertainment. Just don't expect to be wowed by the visuals.This version keeps it concise, framing the film as an enjoyable one-time watch despite its shortcomings.\n",

And the movie's screenplay had me hooked so much that it didn't let me finish my packet of Crisps and my 50ml soda can)Action Sequences 8-9/10 (Thalapathy did amazing here and even other actors too. Venkat Prabhu's direction went really well with these. They just have the usual exaggerated fighting sequences which is normal in our Indian Industry lol)Fighting Choreograohy 10/10 (one of the best parts of the movie. Vijay's career best choreography. He did fantastically)VFX 6-7/10 (u can clearly see some not too good vfx but it wouldn't bother u much, but maybe this rating cuz I was expecting more)Comedy 9-10/10 (u will definitely find urself laughing, some sex jokes are made too lol)Vijay Acting 10/10 (we get to see his goofy side, emotional, serious, psycho etc. One of his career best acting)Background score 10/10 (no doubts needed. Yuvan proved us wrong when we doubted him. Movie wouldn't be the same without the backing score and it was AMAZING)Songs 8-9/10 (when we first listened nobody really liked it, but ur opinion will be changed when u watch it on screen. It's A WHOLE LOT better and Thalapathy dance in the last song was üî•üî•üî•üëåüèΩüëåüèΩüëåüèΩeasily best dances in his recent movies.Cameos 9/10 (first cameo you'll see is not so great cuz AI was used instead of the real person. Every other cameo was a banger and some even unexpected)References to other movies 10/10 (they referenced like 20 movies, some of them not even Vijay's.)Easily TOP 4 Vijay movies. And illayathalapathy stope the show. Forget his ridiculous look, it suits his personality.It's more like a Venkat Prabhu film rather than a thalpathy film.Cons:1. Decent VFX2. First cameo was bad but respectable3. We get an AI thalapathy in one scene and it wasn't too great. Good try thoughOverall Movie Rating 8.5-9/10.But I'll give it 10/10 for the effort the team put into making the movie. It was a mass entertainer and can watch more than once. People expected too much from it and when the movie doesn't meet their expectations, it's marked as a bad movie by them.

            "Review 165: A pakka theatre experience movie for those who love entertainers. Not for review kings who make surgery in to a movie.It have all the commercial elements to cater the entertainment for audiance. Thalapathy vijay is the show stealer with his all round performance in double role.He danced well, He performed well, His comedy timing was nice, Sentiments worked well, His action scenes were too good. Family audience welcome the movie in upcoming days.Cinematography, Action Choreography, Direction and All supporting cast were good.The main disappointment in the movie is YUVAN SANKAR RAJA !If the movie is receiving negative reviews, thats only because of Music and Background Score.\n",

Especially loved the humor in the beginning of the movie. Last 40 mins climax is s brilliant you cannot even blink your eyes. Thalapathy Vijay's acting is the biggest strength in this movie. Direction and screenplay is very good. Everyone played their part very well. Director gave importance to everyone in the movie which we can't see much in any movie. Loved the interval block . Loved the OG part which is completely unexpected.This movie is full of surprises, twists and turns. Its a complete package.\n",

If Vijay returns to his cinematic career he must absolutely sign a sequel of this picture .Mass choreography, the Ai techonlogy of Captain Vijayakanth worked very well. All songs are chartbuster .

            "Review 169: It's Ilayathalapathy versus Thalapathy. One is a good guy and the other is bad one. A young man vs an older one, bringing double the fun and double the action. Director Venkat Prabhu tries to show the audience why this film and Vijay is GOAT to his fans and the audience.GOAT takes off in Kenya in 2008 where we see a special anti-terrorist squad (SATS) team recover stolen uranium from a group of terrorists led by Omar and Rajiv Menon (Mohan). Gandhi (Vijay) and his team members-cum-friends Kalyan (Prabhu Deva), Sunil (Prashanth), Shaaam (Ajay) come back victorious to India but create havoc in the mission and receive flak from their chief Nazeer (Jayaram) for this. The group of men are thick as thieves and like to party and this is what gets Gandhi into trouble with his pregnant wife Anu (Sneha), who is quite suspicious of his activities.To keep Anu and his son Jeevan happy, Gandhi decides to take them to Thailand when he is assigned a mission. And this is where things go terribly wrong. Gandhi and his family are attacked by a gang and Anu ends up in hospital while Jeevan ends up kidnapped and killed. Cut to years later and we see things have changed - Gandhi is on a desk job and he is separated from Anu. But terror strikes again in the form of Sanjay. What does Gandhi do ? Who is Sanjay ? How does the SATS team save the day ? Does Gandhi reunite with his family ? Is it a happy-ever-after ?Director Venkat Prabhu must first be lauded for writing a story that travels the world and has family sentiment, action, humour and drama interlaced with twists and plenty of tributes. He has given Thalapathy Vijay a story that is quite different from the Tamil star's last few outings and it's refreshing. Vijay is seen in two roles and the two characters are radically quite different and that's what makes it interesting. Venkat Prabhu has loaded the film with a lot of tributes starting from Captain Vijayanath, SPB and Ajith's Mankatha hook step to his late cousin, Bhavatharini, and numerous Vijay films.The first half of GOAT is extremely engaging with the director setting up the stage for superb interval block that takes you by surprise. There is a lot of family drama and high-octane action in various missions around the world before the film hits the interval. Post interval, the film takes off with a face off between the Gandhi and Sanjay and the director tries to keep it fast-paced. Through the film, Venkat Prabhu shows he is a fanboy of Vijay, the Kollywood (references to Ghilli, Thirumalai, etc) and the climax of the film definitely proves this. This is not to say that there are no lags in the film but the superb performance of Vijay and the large ensemble cast makes you forgive this. The director capitalises totally on Vijay's trademark charm, sentiment, action, dance and humour and this is sure to appeal to his fans and the audience.GOAT is a Venkat Prabhu treat for Thalapathy Vijay fans and the audience. This Vijay film is an action-packed, fun, wholesome entertainer!\n",

            "Review 170: Watched this movie on Netflix with great expectations. But starting with initial fight sequence, everything about this movie including background music, script, direction, editing was big let down. Background music was average, nothing outstanding. Same with music. Storyline, editing and direction was below average. Its almost 3 hours movie and one would need patience to watch it completely. I watched it in fast forward mode. After some 1 hour 40 minutes, you can directly jump to last 10mins. You wont miss anything.The storyline was predictable, and didn't make any sense.

De-ageing looked decent, but the VFX and production values are average.Coming to Venkat Prabhu, on paper, this looks a good idea, 1st half was decently engaging, but second half was below par. Few meta references, cameos worked, but this needed MANKATHA Level direction.Bottomline: Watch it if you wanna see the sinister side of Vijay.\", 'Snapchat and insta filters was used in the first scene and most of the vfx work.

The background music (BGM) doesn't add much value and lacks the impact that could have elevated key moments.Visually, the movie also falls short, with subpar makeup and VFX that don't meet expectations, leaving certain scenes underwhelming. There are some cameo appearances, but they do little to lift the overall experience.In conclusion, the movie is an average offering that serves as a one-time watch.

Vivegam came close but it failed to appeal to all the sections (I like Vivegam btw). We dont even want to talk about Spyder.So, VP and AGS smartly cooked it safe, made it appealing for everybody, promoted the movie saying the same thing, did not give it much hype, added cameos, did fan service, maintained the graph throughout so that everybody comes out with a satisfactory feeling.Did the movie has flaws? Of course, yes. But, it doesn't matter as long as you want to just have some time pass fun and leave the theatre.I wouldn't watch it for a second time barring few good scenes here and there.

So when vijay joined hands with VP in his pen ultimate movie before his political entry,it was either going to be in the top leagues like mankatha or in the bare bottom like mass.Just like every vijay movies nowadays, the hype was surreal.The movie begins with the squad going on a mission somewhere in Kenya. After the usual opening fight sequences what follows is a tiring family moments (made for the family audiences)which could have been made better.The first half faces a lag with predictable screenplay but the peak point of the movie is the final 40 minutes or so ,where it keeps your adrenaline pumping throughout with delightful cameos and twists ..\\nThe big letdown though is yuvan's bgms and songs. Especially the spark song. It's so unnecessary that it interrupts the flow of the movie.Vijay does his best portraying the duo of father and son.

Director #VenkatPrabhu has outdone himself with this one, delivering a movie that feels like a rollercoaster ride around the globe. It\\'s not just an action-packed thriller but also a heartfelt family drama with plenty of humor, unexpected twists, and nods to #Vijay\\'s iconic filmography.#ThalapathyVijay takes on two vastly different roles, showcasing his versatility like never before. It\\'s a refreshing change from his recent films, and he absolutely nails it. The first half of the movie is gripping, thanks to @vp_offl\\'s masterful storytelling and a mind-blowing interval block that sets the stage for an exhilarating second half.Post-interval, the pace never slows down. The action sequences are slick and stylish, with plenty of whistle-worthy moments that will have fans cheering in their seats. Thalapathy Vijay shines throughout, bringing his signature charm, emotional depth, and flawless dance moves. Whether it\\'s delivering a punchline or a punch, he\\'s in top form, connecting effortlessly with fans and family audiences alikeA heartfelt tribute to Captain #Vijayakanth is woven seamlessly into the narrative, adding another layer of emotion. The climax is a high point, leaving you on the edge of your seat and craving more. Despite its 3-hour runtime, the movie feels brisk and engaging-it\\'s a thrill ride you won\\'t mind taking again.Kudos to producer @archanakalpathi for bringing this grand spectacle to the big screen. Technically, \"GOAT\" matches up with the best of Hollywood\\'s action flicks, making it a true cinematic experience. This is a film you\\'ll want to watch more than once, especially with your family!', \"M. S. Gandhi (Vijay) is an SATS officer along with his buddies/colleagues Sunil (Prashanth), Kalyan (Prabhudeva), Ajay (Ajmal Ameer) and their boss is Naseer (Jayaram). They almost capture the dreaded criminal Rajiv Menon (Mohan) who once was their boss, now turned terrorist but the mission is still successful in retrieving the Uranium. Rajiv is presumed train in the aftermath of the mission. The work obviously affects the personal life of Gandhi and a mission in Thailand leads to an attack on his family, resulting in a personal loss which impacts his marital life. Years later, Gandhi is no longer a field agent and the demons from his past catch upto him. With his loved ones life at stake, how does Gandhi resolve the threat, forms rest of the story.Watching a 4am fans show for a Vijay film is an unique experience which I have enjoyed in the past too. Thankfully, Venkat Prabhu has given a better Vijay film compared to his recent outings and this is not to say, Venkat Prabhu has given a perfect outing. The screenplay had to compromised big time to turn it into a star vehicle for Vijay and the first half has hardly any twists. It succeeds in fan service which in turn helps the first half sail through without much complaints.It is the second half which has all the gimmicks and sadly the proceedings gets way too predictable, relying heavily on the gimmicks to save the film. Now there is a positive to this as well considering the gimmicks give the best moments. There are couple classic Venkat Prabhu twists which is executed well and a couple of more predictable twists. The music is a big letdown and the songs only act as a speedbreaker for an already long film. This is Vijay's finest performance as he aces in both the roles of father and son. The writing suffers from focusing majorly on Vijay's characters which leaves several supporting cast to be underwritten which impacts the film in crucial moments. The climax is prolonged but the cameos give out the high as intended, making this into a decent watch. I am going with a lenient rating because it did entertain me well in parts and the very fact that, given the last few films of Vijay, this stands tall. This definitely is among the 5 better Vijay films to come out since 2010. If only the runtime was kept in check and better music, GOAT truly could have been the best of Vijay, whereas performance wise it definitely is.\", 'GOAT: Finally Vijay delivers a massy action and a family entertainment, with plenty of comedy elements. He has delivered his career best acting in this movie, with variety expressions and emotions, and it\\'s a feast to his fans. Venkat Prabhu shows the antagonist with a strong backstory and connects different elements together. Music is a big letdown and songs come abruptly. Three songs could have been cut, but the plot keeps you hooked.Action sequences are shot well. Comic timing is spot on, and certain scenes are hillarious.It\\'s a complete family and action film barring few atrocious scenes which are not kids friendly. Go watch it as it\\'s \"Anna Yaarudi, THALAPATHY\". He is back!', \"Obviously, Vijay's performance as Gandhi was absolutely terrific. Last 40 minutes worked really well that keeps you excited and fun. Moreover, we could applaud VP for few things that taking very normal story and building the screenplay with few interesting twists and keeping you engaged to some extend for 3 hours is definitely not an easy task to do. But, he done that with ease. Matter of fact that de-aging work was amazing and unbelievable though I personaly did not convince the way Vijay perfomed the jeevan character. It looks cringe in few instances especially during the second half. Let's talk about the supporting roles, Prasanth has done a good job, Prabu Deva and Sneha was decent. Mohan and Meenakshi is definitely a miscast. Other people does not have anything to do with a movie. There are few surprises which are interesting. Yuvan songs are big let down and bgm was decent. VFX looks very bad that is not acceptable for a big budget film like GOAT. Few dialogues were ametaure and there is a room for atleast 15min trimming in second half. Finally, VP manages to deliver the engaging and decent entertainer that could have been better. But, it's definitely not even closer to MANKATHA.\", \"Venkat Prabhu, known for his unique style in Tamil cinema, once had a distinct touch that won over audiences. However, his recent ventures seem to suggest otherwise. The decline in his storytelling, direction, and overall execution is evident, leaving many to wonder if he has lost his golden touch.When it comes to cinema, hype plays a significant role. Some movies are massively marketed, creating an inflated sense of expectation. However, there are times when films fail to live up to that hype, and Venkat Prabhu's recent movie is an unfortunate example of this. Fans of the director, who once brought innovative films like *Chennai 600028* and *Saroja*, were left disappointed with his recent release, which can easily be described as one of the worst in his career.First and foremost, the lack of a coherent screenplay was glaring. A movie thrives on its screenplay-it's the backbone of any narrative. Without a compelling and structured storyline, even a star-studded cast can't save a film from falling apart. In Venkat Prabhu's recent outing, the screenplay felt disjointed, with no clear direction. The audience was left wondering where the plot was headed, and that's never a good sign. Several scenes seemed like they were written just to fill in time, lacking any purpose or contribution to the overarching narrative. It became increasingly frustrating to follow a story that seemed to meander without any sense of purpose or focus.Furthermore, the dialogues lacked the spark that was once synonymous with Venkat Prabhu's films. His earlier films were known for witty lines, cultural references, and a blend of humor with emotional depth. However, this time around, it felt forced. There were moments where the dialogues felt unnatural, and rather than drawing the audience into the story, they only served to alienate them further.Another critical aspect was the music, which was incredibly disappointing. Music often plays a crucial role in the success of a film, especially in Indian cinema, where songs are a vital part of storytelling. However, the songs in this film were far from memorable. It's almost shocking to see how the music, usually a strength in Venkat Prabhu's films, fell flat here. The tunes were generic and lacked the energy or emotion necessary to resonate with the audience. They felt like mere fillers, thrown in to check a box rather than enhancing the overall narrative. It begs the question: has Venkat Prabhu lost his touch in selecting or directing the music in his films?Moreover, the performances of the actors couldn't salvage the film either. While the cast had some recognizable faces, they seemed out of place, and it was clear that they were struggling to work with the weak script. The lack of chemistry between the actors was palpable, and it was difficult to connect with any of the characters on screen. This was surprising, especially considering Venkat Prabhu's previous ability to bring out the best in his ensemble casts. The entire movie felt like a missed opportunity.In a world where audiences are increasingly looking for fresh, well-told stories, the film was outdated. The usual charm, wit, and creativity that once defined Venkat Prabhu's movies were glaringly absent. One might even argue that he is stuck in a time warp, still banking on the elements that worked for him a decade ago, without realizing that the audience's taste has evolved.All in all, this film stands as one of the worst not just in Venkat Prabhu's career but in recent Tamil cinema. It wasn't worth the hype it garnered, and for those who went in with expectations, the disappointment was evident. It's a film that will likely be forgotten in no time, and one can only hope that Venkat Prabhu takes this as a learning experience and returns to the form that made him a beloved filmmaker in the first place. His latest venture GOAT leaves us wondering: has he truly lost his touch.\", \"Greatest of all time, GOAT, is a story of an Anti Terrorist Squad agent Gandhi. Story is a big word here as there is none. What we get is a 3 hour long drag fest of well knitted scenes backed by raucous music, flower pot female character and a generous sparkling of supporting characters.Vijay as Gandhi and Jeevan was excellent and the de-aging technology worked well. Other than these two aspects, GOAT offers nothing else. The story, if any, is as predictable as sunrise. The needless call backs to Vijay's past movies were done to please the masses. They were abrupt .The story never settles until the second half of Act 2 and suddenly we get a barrage twists, if which, you would've guessed most of them by that time.Bottom line, this is not GOAT.

It's a no brainer that many of things in film are cliches and are done for many times in past but still this movie was fun although it didn't match up to levels of Vijay's last Film LEO.. Action scenes were good, fight scenes were good and nicely choreographed, at least some of them.. Story was typical secret agent story mixed with family drama like we've seen hundred times before.. BGM was okay not very good, runtime could've been at least 20 minutes shorter.. This film is made for fans of Thalapathy who don't care about anything else other than seeing him.. I've only seen his 3 more films Master, Beast and Leo and this one was weakest of all of them.. Vfx were also just okay. De aging effects on younger Vijay looks fake in some scenes but he delivered a decent performence in both roles.. Rest of cast also acted well even though I don't recognize any of them since I don't watch South Indian movies too much.. Overall it is an decent film meant only for die hard fans of Vijay but rest of audience will also enjoy it.. Will you see it in theatre or skip it for OTT is up to you.. You don't miss anything special..\\nPost Credit scenes sets up sequel which may never come because Vijay is retiring after making only one more movie and i don't think that he'll do sequel to this film as his last project maybe Leo 2 or something new..

The film follows Gandhi, former leader of a special anti-terrorist squad, who reconciles with his squad members to address the problems which were stemmed from their previous actions. Filming locations included Chennai, Hyderabad, Pondicherry, Russia, Thailand, United States, and the climax being shot at Greenfield International Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram which was wrapped by late-June 2024. The film has music composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, cinematography handled by Siddhartha Nuni and editing by Venkat Raajen.', 'It is true that Venkat Prabhu has made a perfect commercial film for Tamil cinema especially squirrels after a long time!. Although the film has a very simple story, the script was spiced up enough for a commercial cinema and it was good to eat!. The squirrels have been asking the directors who are going to make a film with Vijay for a long time, Venkat Prabhu brought out another angle of \"Vijay\" and handled it \"70%\" and Vijay established it with his performance, like \"Priyamudan\" directed by Vincent Selva in 1998, can add success to the film! (The movie \"Priyamudan\" is known only to real squirrel chicks). Why is it that when an artist creates a work (whether it\\'s purely \"art\" or \"business\") we associate the artwork with the epics that artist has created before? Some artists create their new work for a purpose, and the question is, what wins? Does it fit the purpose? In that way, Yuvan Shankar Raja\\'s music was appropriate when watching this commercial movie!. While the de-aging process is perfect at many points, it would have been better if they had worked on the VFX scenes (truthfully there is only so much that can be done for the budget and time given here) except for a few songs and some unnecessary intros. The film is like a road trip for the squirrels who only think of Vijay from top to bottom!', \"Venkat Prabhu's latest film is a well-crafted narrative that grips the audience from start to finish, proving once again why he remains one of the most promising filmmakers in contemporary cinema. The storyline is not only engaging but also filled with twists that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. From the very beginning, the director ensures that there's a consistent pace, avoiding unnecessary lulls that could lose the audience's attention. This balance in pacing is critical to maintaining a sense of excitement and intrigue throughout the film's running time.What stands out in this film is the treatment of characters. Each major character has been given equal importance, which is often a challenge in ensemble casts. Venkat Prabhu ensures that no one is sidelined or underutilized. This not only allows for more depth in the story but also makes the audience invest in the characters on an emotional level. Every character has their moment to shine, and their arcs are interconnected in a way that feels organic rather than forced. This is an admirable feat of storytelling, as keeping multiple characters relevant while maintaining narrative flow can be tricky. In this film, however, the characters' journeys are woven together seamlessly, contributing to the overall impact of the story.One of the most striking aspects of the movie is the antagonist. The villainous role is crafted with a level of detail and flair that elevates the character into one of the film's most memorable features. The antagonist's presence is not just a typical opposition to the protagonist but a fully realized character with motivations that make them stand out. The way the antagonist is portrayed is hellishly awesome and genuinely celebrates the darker side of human nature in a way that feels fresh and exciting. It's a character that fans will likely remember long after the credits roll, as they bring an intensity and charisma that lifts the entire narrative.The visuals in the film are another strong point. Venkat Prabhu's direction is complemented by stunning cinematography, which adds a layer of immersion to the overall experience. The way certain scenes are shot, coupled with the film's color palette and visual effects, makes it a visual spectacle. Fans of the director will appreciate the attention to detail and the way he uses visual storytelling to enhance the narrative. Whether it's the intense action sequences or the quieter, more emotionally charged moments, the visual composition consistently enhances the story, making it a true treat to watch on the big screen.While the film excels in many areas, one aspect that could have been better is the music. Yuvan Shankar Raja, who has delivered iconic soundtracks in the past, falls just short of the high expectations set for him. The background score and songs, while not bad by any means, don't reach the heights one might hope for in a Venkat Prabhu film. However, this minor shortcoming does not detract too much from the overall experience. The music serves its purpose and complements the film, even if it isn't as memorable as some of Yuvan's previous work.Overall, Venkat Prabhu delivers a movie that is sure to entertain a wide range of audiences. The film is packed with engaging characters, an exceptional antagonist, and visuals that make it worth experiencing in theaters. Fans of the director and the genre will find plenty to enjoy, while even casual viewers will appreciate the high-quality production values and the tightly woven narrative. Despite some minor hiccups with the music, the film is an exciting and well-executed piece of entertainment that should not be missed. Whether you are a die-hard fan or someone looking for a fun theatrical experience, this film is definitely worth watching at least once.\", \"The Greatest of All Time, this movie had the lowest hype for a Vijay movie. Venkat Prabhu and Premji mentioned that they did something like Sivaji the boss for Vijay but GOAT is not even near Sivaji. The story evolves around a son and his father. Very small scaled story although this film travels around so many places.Cinematography was okayish, Yuvan's background score was good but could've done better. Commercial films are known for having a good album, this film lacks a good audio album. I don't understand why directors can't understand that a movie's duration should be around 2h 30m to 2h 40m. You don't have to drag till 3hrs.Overall: one time watchable entertainer. 6/10.Strictly for Vijay fans but general audience may find a lot of mistakes in the film.\", \"I saw GOAT today first day.Positive:\\nVijay Gandhi character looks are good.Cons.Bad story. Bad music.Poor casting. Weak screenplay. Bad vfx.Also child torture scenes are shown, it should be shown labl as violence towards children are punishable. It's not shown. Very mind disturbing scenes.One of the worst film of Vijay.Continuous Bad films Vijay Giving.It's a story of a secret agent. Poor story. Waste of money.Why a film like this. What is the entertainment in this type of film. Vijay young animation look is comic.Venkat Prabhu also must stop making films..My rating 2/10.2 for Vijay Gandhi character look.\", \"This latest Vijay film is a major letdown. Despite his usual charisma, the movie is a slog. The plot is predictable and fails to engage, with a narrative that drags and lacks originality. Vijay's performance, though earnest, is undermined by a poorly written character and weak screenplay. The direction is uninspired, leading to a disjointed flow and lackluster pacing. The technical aspects, from cinematography to music, add little value. Overall, the film is a disappointing experience and not worth the watch, even for Vijay fans. The film falls flat and fails to deliver any lasting impact, don't watch.\", \"Movie Review: G. O. A. T. ( Greatest of all time) streaming on Netflix!!Touted as Thalapaty Vijay's penultimate film before his entry into politics, GOAT is a Tamil action thriller film starring Vijay in a dual role, alongside Prashanth, Prabhu Deva, Mohan, Jayaram, Sneha, Laila, Ajmal Ameer, Meenakshi Chaudhary, Parvati Nair, Vaibhav, Yogi Babu, Premgi Amaren and Yugendran.Great star cast for sure!!The film tells the story of Gandhi ( Vijay) and his Special Anti Terrorism Squad (SATS) team members. Following a botched mission in Thailand in 2008 , Gandhi goes into self imposed exile before he is called back in 2024 to deal with the repercussions of the failed mission along with an unlikely antagonist, a younger version of himself!!Loud music & over the top action scenes are the hallmark of the film giving the audience what it wants !ABT the performances... Vijay's double role as the father and son is decent except for the buffoonery shown in the guise of comedy in the first half. Putting comedy scenes in the middle of a serious action scene is extremely irritating & distracting . I have seen this happen even in a magnum opus like Kalki . Kyon yaar\\uf8ffüò°\\uf8ffüò°... Not needed\\uf8ffüò°\\uf8ffüò°.There are a couple of twists in the Storyline which are guessable yet well executed!! Watch out for Prabhu Deva in the film , a restrained performance for a change. Actions scenes have been decently showcased especially the Fights scenes between Vijay's older and younger version \\uf8ffüëç\\uf8ffüëçFirst half is the weak link , but the sceond half is gripping, though the final climax seemed a bit too streched. Again the story is nothing to boast about, been there, seen it a million times . Songs too seem unnecessarily inserted at times disrupting the narrative. Also the film is around 3 hrs long , runtime could have easily been reduced by 30 mins by doing away with some songs and unnecessary comedy scenes in the first half !!Bottom line... If u liked Jawaan u r sure to like this one !! Total maar dhaad film that is predictable, yet has its moments.Going with 3/5 for this one.. Adios \\uf8ffüôÇ!!#sanjuzzreviews #thalapathyvijay #thalapathy68 #ThalapathyIsTheGOAT #greatestofalltime #filmreview #moviereview.\", \"I have always enjoyed Vijay films. But in my opinion, this movie and Beast are the worst of his career. I will forever call this movie the worst of all time (woat ).Vijay has so many cringeworthy dialogues and scenes. He imitates so many actors and it's embarrassing. Dude. Do you no longer have your own style or mannerisms? He copies Rajini, of course. Then, Sivaji, Kamal, Prakash Raj, and Shahrukh. Ridiculous. Glad Vijay is retiring from films. He no longer has anything to offer but endless copying and cringe.Gandhi character was ok. But Jeevan character was so cheap - dialogues and all felt like b grade. As usual, heroines have nothing to do in a Vijay movie. Songs and BGM are a huge letdown.Was good to see Prasanth in a film after so long. He has done a good job. Prabhu Deva too. Mohan was miscast. He looked like a buffoon and not as the antagonist. Movie was so predictable and datedOverall, this movie has nothing to offer. And is 3 hours of Vijay for his fans. Nothing more. Still better than Indian 2 though. \\uf8ffüòÇ\", \"Lets start with Negatives First !Clich√© story ,Weak songs and VFX is down in some areas and if you want to consider Logical elements ; Please Guys Don't watch this ,Watch something else !But I got Entertained Well ! How you wondering ? Lets talk about positives then : Fast Paced Screenplay ,Cameos Impressed , De Aging Technology Using is Superb , Terrific Dance choreography ;especially for the #matta Song , Decent BGM work and good Actions and Over all Neat making by #VenkatPrabhu !& AMUSING Performance of #vijaythalapathy is for me the Biggest Positive ; Especially Younger role is Fantastic !Commercial movies like this does not need to have a lot of Great elements ,it must have Enough to Entertain us, i got Plenty and i Liked it !Look like #vijayanna got another Blockbuster on Cards !! Hopefully It will be.\", \"This movie has moments every 20 minutes that keep you cheering.The story is interesting,, and the double action from Thalapathy Vijay is amazing. The runtime may be criticised, but personally, it didn't feel that lengthy. The plot twists and the songs are very good. The antagonist could have been more powerful but when you watch the movie, it makes sense on why he isn't. Yuvan Shankar Raj was criticised before the movie was released;; however, he has proven that he was the correct selection for this VP hero. His bgm elevates the movie as a whole, especially the post-credits scene which has you on edge. The interval and climax scenes are the highlight of this movie.Venkat Prabhu has proved to us on why Vijay sir is The Greatest of All Time when it comes to the acting, the dancing and the singing. It really is upsetting that he is leaving the industry to pursue politics, given the fact that he is at his peak.You should definitely give The Greatest of All Time a watch.\", \"The film has got plot with surprisingly ironic yet unexpected scenes. But I think the songs were bad and there were several illogical scenes which influenced the movie such as Menon being alive still after the train blast and even Menon being alive is impossible.'whistle podu' was okay but the other two songs was bad. But the Bgm was nice. I wanted to give 7.5 out of 10 but the an option isn't there and the cameos was also bad of Sivakarthikeyan and Trisha were a. Bit uncessary. Overall Vijay's past films with Lokesh and Atlee were way more better. From Master to leo we have been good songs but we didn't get in this one I hope thalapathy 69 will be nice.\", \"A wasted opportunity by VP.Vijay is almost at the end of his career and these directors don't understand that Vijay can never pull off a negative role with ease.Vijay's strength is entertainment. Give him more dance, comedy, love portions, heroic roles.Anti-heroism requires a performance powerhouse, menacing expressions, powerful voice and so on which Vijay lacked since ATM days till Leo.#WeakStory #UnengagingScreenplay #AmateurishPerformances #PoorGraphicz #HorribleSongs #PoorBGM and much more.As a matter of fact, there are few high moments VP has placed for Vijay. Most of the highs are created by cameos amd references.Easily one of the worst work by VP. May be Vijay guessed it right like Leo, hence avoided and Audio launches and promotions.\", \"We currently have no data available on what happened to the legendary director who crafted a high octane action film like 'Mankatha'. While the recent release 'Maanadu' was a hit, 'The Greatest Of All Time' is a miss and undeniably a huge pile of mess.Thalapathy Vijay's much anticipated entry into TN politics stirring debates, GOAT had high expectations and Venkat Prabhu has let down everyone. I hope their trip to Russia and Thailand was worth it because they sure have fabricated a vacation into a screenplay that did not necessarily need it.Yuvan Shankar Raja'a music and Prabhu Deva's choreography make GOAT a bearable experience while Dhilip Subbarayan's stunt work deserves critical applause. Vijay himself has poured his heart and soul into this film, his triple appearance is definitely a treat to his fans but he could have curbed his acting. Overacting is a side effect of poor direction and again I blame Venkat Prabhu.The movie reeks of age old clich√©s, the father vs son trope is no longer emotional anymore and the characterization also doesn't leave much to be desired. Filler face Sneha, low class acting Laila, just for star value Prashant, annoying as usual Jayaram - Don't get me wrong - they are all fantastic actors but the script has ruined them.You can find yourself laughing during serious moments, and if you are fan of cinema, you can see 'twists' turning up from miles ahead. Premji is one character that I hated whole heartedly. Contrastingly, Trisha was a delight to see on screen, her first performing a solo dance number in her 20+ years of experience in the industry.The 40 minute climax was overly long and as audience, I was waiting for the movie to end. I am not a fan of Vijay but I like him and it's heartbreaking to realize that this disaster of a film could potentially be his last impression in the Tamil Cinema Industry.\", \"#OkDirection #GoodActing #NiceStory #FunWatchThis movie is made for THALAPATHY fans and this movie is doing its fan service.telepathy and other co stars acting like prabhudeva, Prasanth, sneha's acting were good but not upto the mark. Music was randomly placed anywhere in the movie. However most of the plot scenes were shocking. BUT this movie would have done better. This movie is getting a great audience reaction because of its action scenes are well choreographed. Its unbelievable to see at such a age of 50 THALAPATHY does such an amazing action and wonderful acting. OVERALL this movie is a must ONE TIME WATCH.\", \"Goat amazing entertainment and awsom movie thalabathy vs illayathalabathy dual role acting was great A Lion is always a Lion.. Dhoni cameo SK Cameo was goosebumps. Yuvan shankar raja Music and bgm was good overall extraordinary performance from all actors...

Despite its 3-hour runtime, the movie feels brisk and engaging-it's a thrill ride you won't mind taking again. This movie will cross 1000 Crores club and it will be the 1st flim for vijay to cross 1000 crores.....\", 'Oh man its so hard to write a review for this movie. To be honest with all, i am a die hard fan of Vijay, but didnt expect such a disasterous movie. All money wasted, no logics, no good screenplay and mainly the same old story. Nothing new in this , just they have added more cameos to attract people more in the theaters. To the hype , this movie has vanished . The music and bgm is the worse didnt expect this from yuvan, there were songs which isnt relevant to the pace of the movie. It affects the movie. First half is much better than 2nd half. The love portion and the humour part was nice. VP can do only humour movies, he can continue that. Dont make garbages , i am so disappointed. Another positive is Vijay his acting and performances were soo good but to a poor directional blunt. To much load of casts which didnt even match the requirement of such charcterisation. Every scene and every thing happens suddenly for no reason, just a terrible screenplay overall. Overall aan average vijay movie, even the mass moments are low gor vijay, there was only one though. Please do watch it in theaters (if you can please dont watch) VP just made a mess of it, below average direction.', '1. Bloated with Action and Songs\\nThe action sequences are thrown in just for the sake of adding masala, but they don\\'t serve the story in any meaningful way. The choreography is lackluster, and instead of being high-octane, they feel painfully drawn out. The songs? Totally unnecessary. They disrupt the flow of the film and feel like they were added purely as filler to make the runtime unbearable. None of them are memorable or serve any purpose other than to test the audience\\'s patience.2. Cringe-Worthy Cloning Effects\\nIn what is perhaps one of the most cringe-inducing parts of the film, the addition of Vijay duplicates at the end takes the cake for useless, outdated, and downright embarrassing special effects. The \"cloning\" gimmick might have been novel a decade ago, but here, it looks like something pulled out of the early 2000s and just thrown on screen with no thought. It\\'s not impressive-it\\'s ridiculous.3. Old-School, Outdated Execution\\nThe entire movie feels like it\\'s stuck in a time warp. The fight scenes are outdated, the romantic subplots are stereotypical, and the comedic moments are just unfunny. The film seems to rely on tropes and clich√©s that might have worked 20 years ago but feel completely out of place in modern cinema.4. Unnecessary Masala\\nEvery time you think the film is going to move forward, it takes another detour to throw in more masala moments-forced hero worship, overdone slow-motion shots, and unrealistic stunts that completely disengage you from the narrative. The masala here doesn\\'t spice things up-it just makes the movie feel overcooked and stale.5. Wasted Potential and Poor Direction\\nIt\\'s clear that there was potential for a more gripping story, but the direction falters at every turn. Instead of focusing on character development or a cohesive plot, the film relies on old-school tricks, long-drawn-out scenes, and a barrage of pointless sequences that only serve to bloat the runtime.6. Not worth intro of SK and Trisha with songs, how does Vijaya knows SK name while he says \"Shiva\" so silly.Quite a lot of errors to list out..In short, *GoAT* feels like a tired retread of outdated concepts, with poorly executed action and cringe-inducing effects. Save yourself the trouble-this 3-hour journey is not worth it.', \"The Greatest of all time is an action - thriller movie . Vijay's dual performance is interesting while the story is not .Other characters are not given much importance. It's all about the Vijays. Action scenes , chases and the opening sequences were quite engaging. Shades of Azhagiya tamil makan and Leo can be felt at some moments in this movie .Background score and the songs were not up to the level. The climax sequences were a bit suffocating along with an annoying commentary. The movie could have been better if the commercial aspects were cut out.

Sorry, MASTERPIECE.\", \"#TheGoat, here's my take on itThe movie opens with an action scene holding the potential for a grand sequence and sprinkles mere glimpses of a veteran star through mediocrely de-aged visuals and then ends up only revealing the sub-par VFX work - taking us almost back to the treasured 'Kuruvi' days.As we begin forcing ourselves to overlook the middling, sparingly emerges a worthy enough yet short husband wife drama leading on to a nerve wrecking emotional segment. Better late than never, the much awaited take-off finds segway through grief. Although predictable, a handful of attempted twists and turns manages to maintain some grip.The moment in time, within the context of soon to retire big star, a bunch of well placed dialogues bring strong moments of nostalgia. Then comes a couple of amazingly curated and rightly placed cameos, quickly pacing into a goose bumping stretch packing back to back high-moments and a peak climax. Amidst all those little cardamoms and cloves, one may still come out relishing a tummy full moment after a biryani feast.Ash.\", \"VP's G. O. A. T is completely an outdated movie. Except stunt nothing is enjoyable in the movie. It felt like director wanted to make a movie with a minimum guarantee atleast for family audience but yet failed in that as well !!! The movie is full of old references which leaves us frustrated before the end of first half and yet continuous till the climax. Yuvan failed to lift the moments which were arguably one or two in the entire run time. Movie felt like a patch work of different Hollywood movies. Innovation in Technology was a failed attempt. Overall movie was below average and failed attempt which leaves you frustrated about the money you spent for this movie !!!\", \"I wandered into this theater having only read their thumbnail description and figured that I'd have an okay time, despite the daunting three hour investment. Our pathetic audience of four could have played bridge. The others were very sedate throughout. We sat very far apart in the cavernous house. I did periodically peek in on them for reactions. They didn't seem to have a pulse. But I was having a high old time.It started on a high octane note. The lead, Gandhi, got himself on a high speed train through the middle of nowhere. He was securing a stolen sample of U-235, which the captions inform us could blow up to Hiroshima or Nagasaki levels. Needless to say, mission accomplished. There is so much thrilling action in just this scene with him and his anti terrorism colleagues. They all pose as Indian tourism workers as their job, a front which also keeps their adoring families in the dark. Given the amount of twists, turns and flashbacks, it would be exhausting to detail a review. The comedic scenes are hilarious and appear throughout. The dance numbers are lavish, overwrought spectacles. There is a fair amount of romance involving both leading men.For such a sprawling ensemble, it is by and large well cast. Gandhi's wife, played by Sneha Anusuya, is absolutely stunning and talented. I am unfamiliar with the lead, Joseph Vijay. He is a huge star in South Indian film and this is his penultimate film, though he is only fifty. He is incomprehensibly talented, charming and charismatic. I was constantly rooting for him, despite his increasingly poor survival chances. Rajiv Menon made a great villian in Mohan. The director, Venkat Prabhu, is obviously a patient and wise man with great taste. The outtakes during closing credits are hysterically funny and as entertaining as anything in the film itself. What a wonderful coda. At one point, Gandhi recreates the Mission Impossible theme song, which is a clever homage and cute way to implicitly break the fourth wall. This film's scope and breadth rivals that of RRR, which I saw with a house of 250 happy people. Unfortunately, this film will not find much of an American audience. Their Indian American audience base, enormous in my city, may have seen it on opening Saturday. It's the kind of movie that needs a significant audience for ideal engagement. They don't know what they're missing.\", \"In the time where most of the big stars are taking ages to release their movies while piling up on new projects just for the hype you have to admire Thalapathy Vijay for consistently delivering one movie per year. His last 5 movies may have not been top-notch in all aspects but they have delivered some very good fan service and decent entertainment (probably except Varisu in my opinion).The Greatest of All Time aka G. O. A. T does exactly the same thing that it says in the title: Celebrate Vijay. The movie is a roller coaster ride which has both ups and downs in terms of script and also the making. Script may not be great but it has enough elements to provide the right entertainment. The movie slightly lags or disappoints because of the unnecessary goofiness and just above average visual effects. Although the movie does have some Venkat Prabhu signature elements of twists and double games it lacks the surprise elements. Most of the plot twists are very predictable and a chaotic screenplay doesn't help their cause. I was initially disappointed thinking the trailer may have revealed too much, but eventually certain parts of the trailer cut seem like a genius effort. The movie is not really great (or should I say the GOAT) with its technical departments. Action sequences don't feel refreshing and the iconfusing cinematography doesn't help its cause. The main BGM theme along with the rap song is amazing but it isn't used well enough and there are unnecessary placement of songs especially in the era where movies are evolving away from the same.Thalapathy Vijay definitely gives it all playing the main role(s). He has played a unique dual role and I cannot reveal more about it as it could be a spoiler. Unfortunately, his look with the de-aging technology probably takes away some of the greatest moments and makes them look more cringy. There are some scenes which probably only suit Vijay's style and it is kind of hard to imagine a different actor pulling those off. The movie also has some great supporting cast and some very special appearances (some of which have references beyond the movie). Prashanth and Sneha play really strong characters and both are excellent. Most of the supporting characters have decent roles except Meenakshi Chaudhary whose role is again a bit stereotypical eye candy at times. Premgi Amaren and Yogi Babu's comedy does work in most parts but feels predictable at times. Kokila Mohan as the antagonist adds a unique dimension but his role could have been written better.The Greatest of All Time tries to be both Thalapathy Vijay's trademark movie and Venkat Prabhu's at the same time and falls short on both aspects. It is definitely an entertainer if you don't think too much and it's a blast ;) for Vijay and CSK fans. The movie also does its bit to lay out the red carpet for Vijay's political journey.\", '\"GOAT - The Greatest of All Time\" is a film that, despite its ambitious title, falls short of expectations in almost every aspect. Directed by Vijay, the film seems to have aimed for a grand spectacle but ended up delivering a disappointing experience for the audience. While the movie does have a few redeeming qualities, such as the comedic timing of Yogi Babu and the acting prowess of Mohan, these elements are not enough to save it from its numerous flaws. Ultimately, \"GOAT\" stands as an unfortunate example of poor storytelling and weak execution in many critical areas.One of the film\\'s most glaring issues is its lack of engaging content (GC). The narrative struggles to maintain a coherent and compelling storyline, leaving the audience disconnected from the plot. There seems to be a clear deficiency in the development of the characters and the overall direction of the movie. Rather than drawing viewers into a well-crafted story, the film meanders through scenes that feel disjointed and aimless, making it difficult for the audience to stay invested. This lack of substance is a key factor in why \"GOAT\" feels like a missed opportunity, despite the talent involved.The background music (BGM), which is typically a crucial element in setting the tone and enhancing the emotional depth of a film, is another major disappointment. In \"GOAT,\" the BGM fails to complement the scenes or elevate the dramatic moments. Instead of adding intensity or emotion, the music often feels out of place and, at times, distracts from the unfolding events. A well-crafted score can make or break a movie, and in this case, the lackluster BGM contributes to the overall sense of mediocrity.Additionally, the film\\'s songs, which are often a highlight in Indian cinema, fall flat. None of the tracks manage to leave a lasting impression, and they seem hastily put together, lacking the lyrical or melodic appeal that one would expect from a film of this scale. In an industry where songs can sometimes define a movie\\'s success, the forgettable music of \"GOAT\" is a clear indication of the film\\'s failure to capture the audience\\'s imagination.Perhaps the most critical flaw, however, lies in the screenplay. Written by Vijay and his team, the screenplay is riddled with problems that undermine the entire film. The pacing is erratic, with certain scenes dragging on unnecessarily while others feel rushed and underdeveloped. There are moments where the plot seems to go nowhere, leaving viewers confused about the direction of the story. The lack of cohesion in the screenplay makes it difficult to follow, and it\\'s clear that more effort should have been put into crafting a narrative that is both engaging and logical.Mohan\\'s performance is one of the few bright spots in \"GOAT.\" As a seasoned actor, he brings a level of gravitas to his role that helps anchor the film, even when the script fails him. His nuanced portrayal adds some depth to an otherwise shallow narrative, and his presence on screen is one of the few reasons why some audience members may still find moments of enjoyment in the film. Similarly, Yogi Babu\\'s comedic scenes provide brief respites from the otherwise lackluster proceedings. His jokes land well, and his comedic timing adds some much-needed levity to the movie. However, relying on a few jokes to carry the film is not enough to make up for its other shortcomings.Vijay\\'s decision to helm this project raises questions about his creative choices. It\\'s evident that the story plot, penned by Vijay himself, is deeply flawed. The premise of the film had the potential to be something great, but the execution falls flat. The weak plot and poor direction result in a movie that feels like a chore to sit through, and it\\'s hard not to be disappointed by the outcome.In conclusion, \"GOAT - The Greatest of All Time\" is far from living up to its title. While Mohan and Yogi Babu provide some moments of enjoyment, the film is ultimately let down by its lack of engaging content, poor background music, forgettable songs, and a deeply flawed screenplay. Vijay\\'s decision to pursue this story was a misstep, and the movie stands as one of his weaker efforts. For a film with such high expectations, \"GOAT\" ends up being a disappointment on nearly all fronts.', '1st half is ok with Vijay acting & visual but after de-aging Vijay appears downfall of the movie started with cringe acting & worst screenplay..story of 30 years back with worst screenplay not engaged the common audience..This film is only for Vijay fans not for ordinary audience..another middle age Vijay de-aging looks awkward, vfx of the movie is worst to core.

Despite the buildup and anticipation surrounding \"GOAT,\" the movie fails to live up to its promise, delivering an underwhelming experience that raises questions about the direction of South Indian cinema and the larger aspirations of pan-Indian storytelling.From the outset, it\\'s evident that \"GOAT\" was positioned as a blockbuster, designed to cater not just to Vijay\\'s massive fanbase but to also make waves across India. The movie features an ensemble of big names, solidifying expectations that this would be a landmark film. Unfortunately, those expectations quickly unravel as the narrative progresses. The storyline, which should have been gripping and tightly woven, instead feels disjointed and often meandering, a far cry from the cohesive and compelling narratives we expect from pan-Indian productions.The Plot That Never Came TogetherThe most glaring issue with \"GOAT\" lies in its weak storytelling. While Venkat Prabhu has proven himself capable of helming engaging stories in the past, this time around, he seems to lose control of the narrative. The film meanders between subplots that never fully develop, leaving audiences confused and disengaged. For a movie that boasts such a massive star like Vijay, it\\'s baffling how little his character is allowed to shine. The script doesn\\'t give him the platform he deserves, especially for a film that claims to represent the \"Greatest of All Time.\"Moreover, the pacing is uneven. Certain scenes are dragged out unnecessarily, while others are rushed, with no room for character development or emotional investment. This lack of balance is a major flaw, making it hard to connect with the story or its characters.### Star-Studded Cast, But No SparksOne of the biggest talking points before the film\\'s release was its stellar cast. Besides Vijay, the movie features numerous South Indian film industry heavyweights. Yet, despite this ensemble, the movie fails to harness the potential of its talent. What could have been powerful, dynamic performances end up feeling flat, largely because the characters are underwritten or relegated to the background.Vijay, who has a massive following and is known for his larger-than-life roles, is sorely underutilized. His fans, who flocked to see their hero in action, are left wanting more. The action sequences, while visually impressive in parts, lack the intensity and innovation that has come to define contemporary South Indian cinema. It\\'s almost as if the film never finds its rhythm, oscillating between too much spectacle and not enough substance.### A Pan-Indian Film That Feels Too Local\"GOAT\" was marketed as a pan-Indian film, which is a growing trend as South Indian filmmakers aim to capture audiences across the country. However, Venkat Prabhu\\'s execution of this vision falls short. The film lacks the universal appeal that makes a movie like \"Baahubali\" or \"KGF\" resonate beyond regional boundaries. The screenplay feels too rooted in local sensibilities, failing to bridge the gap to a broader audience. While it\\'s important to retain cultural authenticity, there\\'s a fine line between that and alienating viewers from other parts of the country.For a movie aspiring to reach a pan-Indian audience, the lack of a cohesive storyline and relatable characters severely limits its potential impact. The cinematography, while competent, also doesn\\'t rise to the occasion, with scenes that could have been iconic feeling like missed opportunities. Venkat Prabhu\\'s direction, which should have elevated the film, instead feels scattered and unsure.The Action That MisfiresSouth Indian cinema is known for its high-octane action sequences, but \"GOAT\" falls disappointingly short in this regard. The action, which should have been a highlight of the film, feels repetitive and uninspired. There are moments that could have been thrilling, but they\\'re often overshadowed by poor choreography or illogical plot points. Given the talent involved, it\\'s frustrating to see so many action sequences fall flat, devoid of the creativity and energy that audiences expect.A Plea for South Indian CinemaIn conclusion, \"GOAT\" is a significant letdown. Venkat Prabhu, a director who has shown great potential in the past, fails to deliver a compelling film, leaving both Vijay fans and cinema enthusiasts disappointed. The lack of a coherent storyline, underutilized star power, and lackluster action make this movie far from the pan-Indian spectacle it aspired to be.As South Indian filmmakers continue to expand their horizons, aiming for national and international recognition, there needs to be a greater focus on storytelling, character development, and precise execution. If the industry continues to churn out films that prioritize style over substance, it risks losing the momentum it has gained in recent years. Here\\'s hoping that future projects can learn from the shortcomings of \"GOAT\" and truly deliver on the promise of great cinema.', \"After the disappointment of the most anticipated leo thalapathy vijay is back with the Greatest of all time aka G. O. A. T an action thriller film written and directed by venkat prabhu who had previously directed custody which was also a dissappointing one the storyline of the goat is very routine and ordinary to say simply it revolves around gandhi and his teammates ( sunil, kalyan, Ajay ) who are the members of the special anti- terriost squad (SATS )headed by nazeer undergoes a mission in keneya years ago which makes serious issues in their personal years after years how gandhi and his teammtes faces and solves the issues form the rest of the story talking about the postives the first major postive is none other than thalapathy vijay his performance as both Gandhi and jeevan ( father and son ) was brilliant and especially during emotional sequences his performance was top notch and rather than performances he also scores in his usual areas such as action, dance homour etc he is the main pillar of the film other actors such as prashanth, prabhudeva, sneha, ajmal ameer, jayaram, laila, mohan, meenkshi choudary, yogi babu and venkat prabhu's usual artists have done their roles effectively no complaints but some of their characters are not properly written the next positive is the some of the homour sequences involving vijay and sneha, vijay and his teammates and vijay and yogi babu were worked well especially yogi babu's some of the comedies were hilarious the total first half barring the interval point was interesting with no drag moments and it is also a notable postive the next positive is the perfect de aging technic used for vijay's jeevan character prior release the de aging was heavily criticized but in the film it was convincing which had highly saved the film the screenplay by venkat prabhu was crisp and taut in some parts ( pre interval and climax sequences )which is also a postive but also screenplay was highly predictable during some of the scenes the twists and turns in the movie also worked in some parts and it was also predictable in many scenes the easter eggs and the surprising cameos were interesting and entertaining but did not jell with the storyline and also not created a strong impact the background score by yuvanshankar raja was not great but still it was not worst too it was a good one and elevated some of the average scenes to some extent which is also a big positive the jeevan character was written in an effective way and becomes a memorable one than that of the Gandhi 's character the climax sequences was also very good and writing by venkat prabhu was very good on some parts of the movie which is also a positive thing coming to the negatives of the film the first main negative was it's very routine ordinary and generic storyline the story highly resembled vijayakanth 's film rajadurai which was directed by vijay's father sa chandrasekar and Also some of the old commercial tamil films the screenplay as mentioned above was good in some parts but in major parts it fumbles and becomes highly predictable and the twist and turns also become highly prediticable especially in interval and post interval scenes because of weak writing also the characters other than vijay are weakly written especially female characters were highly pathetic and antangoinst role by mohan were highly underwhelming even through mohan's performance was good also the deaging for the character jeevan was good but it also become worst in the post interval scenes where jeevan character was shown much more younger also the other vfx and graphics was also very creepy and looked highly artificial the songs and the placement of them were highly tertible and highly affected the flow of the film especially the song placements of spark and matta were the major drawbacks also the most shocking disappointment was the technical side 's inefficiency cinemotagraphy by siddharata nuni who had done great camera work in vendu thanithathu kadu and capital miller was highly erratic especially in the bangtok sequences and editing was also very narrow and uneven and most surprisingly the action sequences by dhilip subbarayan who had done a brillant work in valimai was highly underwhelming in this movie except the terrific bike chase featuring both vijays in Russia all the other action sequences were not convincing and illogical especially the intro train fight metro fight and even climax too and the tribute they gaven to the late captain vijayakanth in AI was highly shoddy and they would have even avoided this rather than giving a legend a lathergic tribute like this and also Easter eggs which was entertaining beccomes irritating when it becomes over dosage to conclude goat is not the greatest of all time in both vijay and venkat prabhu's career but still it is good despite major flaws effective writing and high technical brillance would have made the film to justify its title overall a partially entertaining commercial potboiler far better than vijay and venkat prabhu's previous outings which will be a delightful watch for his fans and a decent watch for others worth one time watchable in theatre postives : thalapathy vijay's screenpresence and performance, homour portions, jeevan's character arch and de aging technology, first half, pre interval portions, climax and some interesting twists, yuvanshankar raja 's background score, easter eggs and some surprising cameos\\nNegatives : routine and ordinary storyline, predictable screenplay in some parts,yuvanshankar raja's songs and its placement, underwhelming technical work, illogical action sequences, weak character writing ( except thalapathy vijay ) and creepy vfx works.\", 'Gripping screenplay ,multiple twists and excellent cameos and climax makes it a blockbuster Watch..Being his second last movie,a treat for fans and general audience and venkat prabu should be given the credit for the success of the film for the excellent screenplay. Deaging in the movie was at its best compared to the one in the songs.supporting characters were given good roles especially prashant and sneha and prabu deva..cameo by lead actors was excellently placed and well done..Thala reference and CSK match with BGM was goosebumps moment for everyone..A Massive success for Thalapathy and Team..', 'This movie was a complete disaster-a true waste of time. Not only did it fail to entertain, but it also left me frustrated, as if the script had been written by a child with no regard for the audience\\'s intelligence. The filmmakers seemed to be treating viewers like children, offering a painfully convoluted and shallow story.Over-the-Top Acting\\nVijay\\'s performance was a major letdown. His acting was overly exaggerated and hyperactive, making it hard to take any scene seriously. It felt like he was constantly trying too hard to sell jokes that just didn\\'t land. Most of the humor relied on throwbacks, as if the film was banking on pure nostalgia to generate laughs, which only added to the sense of laziness.Uncomfortable Age Gap and Gender Representation\\nThe romantic subplot was particularly cringeworthy, with an uncomfortable 25-year age gap between the lead actor and the girl. It was nauseating to watch. To make matters worse, the women in the movie were treated as mere props, with no real roles or depth beyond standing in the background of scenes.Sloppy Action Sequences\\nThe fight scenes were terribly choreographed, dragging on far too long and lacking any sense of realism or excitement. It was reminiscent of two children play-fighting while making cartoonish \"dhishum dhishum\" sound effects. It reminded me of the disastrous Race 3, another film notorious for its poorly executed action sequences and convoluted story.Conclusion\\nOverall, this movie felt like a lazy vijay fan service, relying on recycled jokes and tired tropes to draw in audiences. The acting was exaggerated, the plot was childish, and the action scenes were laughably bad. It was an experience I wouldn\\'t wish on anyone, and I left the theater wishing I had spent my time elsewhere.', \"3 hours of entertainment bundled with multi star's performances and worth watch.Vijay's performance was top notch and supported by multi stars like Prashant, Jayaram, Sneha, Mohan, Prabhu Deva and Yogi Babu.Last 40 mins was really gave so many goosebumps. Dance, fight, comedy, singing, acting, multi talented person and hard to digest that he is going to quit cinema industry soon.Venkat Prabhu's team really worked very well and kudoos to ags entertainment for this.After Mersal we watched this Family entertainment movie along with my family.Everyone broken in the scene where Vijay cried. He is a complete packaged entertainer and there is no dout in it.Do watch in theaters for better experience.\", 'Thalapathy Vijay delivers a powerhouse performance in \"The Greatest of All Time\" (2024), showcasing his acting prowess and screen presence. The film keeps you guessing with its suspenseful plot, and the screenplay lays a solid foundation for the story.However, the movie falls short of being truly captivating. Some scenes and dialogues feel lackluster, and the pacing struggles to maintain consistent engagement. While certain moments shine, others leave you wanting more.Overall, \"The Greatest of All Time\" is a decent action film elevated by Vijay\\'s performance and a suspenseful narrative. It may not be a masterpiece, but it\\'s worth watching for fans of the actor and those seeking a suspenseful thriller. Just be prepared for some uneven moments along the way.', \"The reason for the 10 stars is how this movie has served to be a proper commercial movie that entertains people who watch it in theatres.People may have a difference of opinion with this, but the the way Venkat Prabhu's screenplay and his effective direction comes into play is really amazing. He has managed to easily pull in one of the best commercial cinemas ever made. Master was the one which hit the sweet spots of commercial cinema back in 2021, but GOAT has to be the best after Master easily.A SATS agent named Gandhi, with his family goes to Thailand, till that you'll get Varisu kind of vibes because of the mannerisms of Vijay. But after the conflict point, the film picks pace and the entire narration becomes different. Fast paced action sequences, made the first half passable.The second half of the movie is where things get interesting with surprise cameos and classic twists that a commercial cinema would have. Though a couple of them were predictable, it was fun to know what happens and then realise what ee expected happened. That was really good. The acting variation between old Vijay and the younger one was clearly visible and that was really good to see from Vijay as a performer. Other than that, Prashanth, Prabhu Deva, Ajmal and everyone were needed for the story and none of the characters felt useless. The action sequences were top notch as well. The choreography was too good and even though the songs were not the best og Yuvan, the BGMs were phenomenal.Now, let's come to the negatives. The de-aging. That is the only negative thing. The youngest version of Vijay looked pathetic and helpless because of the poor VFX. The post teenage version (spark song one) was reworked and that looked better actually. Yes, there were some lags but the racy screenplay made it forget those things. Other than that there were no much negatives to say.Overall, it's a worthy entertainer. Ignore the fully negative reviews. I watched this without any expectations and it was a really great movie. Do watch in theatres!\", \"400 crore budget, yeah Vijay was paid 200 crores, but damn. The VFX, after the team promoting it so much as high quality, there was so much green screen it was unbelievable. The whole de-aging thing was meh at best for Captain Vijayakanth that is, but still the AI generated expressions were so terrible, even worse for the 16 year old version of thalapathy.Coming to the storyline, and script, in general it was very predictable, like what you can gather from the trailer is exactly what the film is. The comedy worked in some places, mainly when Yogi Babu came in the second half, and a few counters from Vijay and Premgi. The runtime being 3 hours, was so unnecessary, and the placements of the songs were in the most bizzare scenes, especially the 'spark' song. The BGM was just so loud and messy at times I don't even know what U1 was trying to do. In the climax, bro just gave up and let the CSK match commentary do the work \\uf8ffüíÄ.In terms of performances, Vijay carried, as always, particularly the 'Illayathalapathy' character, and we were able to see some different acting and mannerisms from Vijay, although the villainism was quite goofy in several instances to be completely honest. As to everyone else, they were decent, nothing extraordinary.The action sequences were just constant shaky cam, and the choreography itself was basic. Basically, the film relied HEAVILY on fan service, and sure the cameos did work and the multitude of references to previous Vijay films and even Venkat Prabhu films.But overall, the film is just for the fans really, and the general audience will probably find this terrible unfortunately.\", \"Vijay carry the whole movie,sad thing he can save the movie.Father Vijay too cringe, Son Vijay really blast it.Miss use our beloved Captain Vijayakanth as Cameo. SK cameo more useless. They use SK just tell Vijay is going for politic so SK is next Vijay.Songs, the intro is enough for whole movie. Don't why have other songs moreover they place the songs at wrong timing.Top Star Prasant is good actor, not use properly same goes to Prabu Deva.Comedy totally not worked except Yogi Babu scenes. Thank to Yogi Babu make us laugh for few minutes.BGM, Yuvan Shankar Raja really do best job.VFX really bad, De - ageing looks like game characters.Waste money.\", \"A movie with loads of expectations - supposed to be VP's multi cast commercial entertainer, surprise cameos, 90s stars comeback, rich production, use of Deaging, Vijay's penultimate film before official political entry etc.Synopsis: Movie starts with Gandhi alongside his colleagues/friends, part of anti-terrorist squad in 2008 doing a string operation in Kenya, kills big fish Menon. Their families not aware of their real job. Gandhi goes for vacation with family where loses his son in accident when enemies kidnap him. Wife leaves Gandhi with new born daughter. 15 years later, Gandhi away from squad for long, seperated from wife but visits daughter often, been in touch with squad friends too. Later he been invited to train young squad alongside reopening squad branch in Russia. Gandhi travels to Russia with squad lead Nazeer where attack been made by Russian protestors where he shockingly meets his once dead son Jeevan alive grown up and part of the mafia. Gandhi returns with Jeevan to India, spends time happily, fall in love with Sunil's daughter, later Gandhi and colleagues face threats, family attacks from Villain Menon who comesback alive. Things worse when bomb attack planned during IPL in Chennai leading to Big chases, actions and whether Gandhi/Squad wins or not is the climax.Positives: Vijay as Gandhi steals the show. In recent films his looks, swag and Screenpresence are extraordinary. Carries film throughout. Prashanth, PrabhuDeva have very good roles as Vijay's friends. Jayaram, Sneha, Laila, Ajmal, Mohan all with their limited screentimes excelled really well. Very happy to see the 90s stars together onscreen and felt nostalgic. Few surprise camoes too. Yogi Babu in his 5-10 mins make us laugh. Much criticised one before movie release was the music, but Yuvan did a fare job indeed with good song numbers and decent bgm (may be not great like other VP + Yuvan combo films, still good). Songs choreography were great as well.Negatives: Issue is with movie plot. Nothing new, cliche in most parts, unnecessary song placements and bad pacing of first half. Intro action scene itself was bad, then cringey scenes in name of family/friends fun, entire first half unable to realise if its a serious movie or spoof. Somehow film picks up in 2nd half. As usual over the top actions, yawnful climax, all these for a regular revenge story.Mohan as Menon performed well but impact wasn't great as Villain. Vijay as Jeevan was so cringey, reminded his role in ATM. Though individual performances are good, yet another Kollywood big movie let down by poor writing , Lengthy too (3 hrs).Deaging in fresh attempt in thamizh movies can be applaudable but not at all required for this plot. Used for Vjkanth role in name of tribute, then for young Vijay. Both looked pathetic and 0 impact unfortunately. Instead, this budget could have been better utilised in other stuffs and making.Guess VP and movie team solely dependant on Thalapathy stardom and the 90s cast. Just One time watchable for the same. Time and again disappointing that proven directors in kollywood can't pull of a Pan India blockbuster or Regional critic successful hit recent times with big thamizh heroes and big production. An average commercial Flick 6.2/10, only for the starcast and performances.\", \"The movie struggles to rise above mediocrity due to its poor execution and ineffective narrative structure. The pacing feels uneven, and there is a noticeable lack of tension or curiosity to draw the audience in. As a result, the film feels disjointed and fails to sustain viewer engagement throughout its runtime. The storytelling lacks emotional depth, offering no significant moments that resonate or leave a lasting impression.The visual effects, which could have been a saving grace, are underwhelming and do little to enhance the experience. Instead, they feel generic and poorly integrated, further diminishing the film's appeal. The director appears to have relied heavily on references and homages, but without a solid script to back them up, these efforts come across as shallow and uninspired. This lack of originality and creative direction is the movie's greatest shortcoming.For fans of the lead actor, the film might offer a few moments of solace, but it's clear that this is not the strong, compelling performance they were hoping for. The unfortunate reality is that the movie fails to deliver on its promise and falls short of expectations, leaving even the most loyal fans struggling to find reasons to celebrate it.\", \"One Line Review : In Name only Great but it's not the Greatest when it comes to viewing. ‚≠ê ‚≠ê Half ‚≠êThe story is about MS GANDHI the protagonist, who is in ATS & the movie begins with his mission. Later on how that mission creates an impact on his personal life is all about the movie.If anyone who has watched spy action movies a lot , GOAT doesn't provide anything new.This movie is a pakka VIJAY movie with his dance, with his usual naughtiness, with his style action, his references from his previous movies and all that. Once again it's fully on Vijay's shoulder to carry such a not so great story making it a watchable factor.The majority of the artists like Laila , Jayaram , Sneha , Meenakshi, Ajmal , Prabudeva , VTV Ganesh, Venkat Prabhu's fixed actors in his earlier movies didn't have any impactful performance.The 1st half goes on a fast pact ,the only high moment for me was the bike chase sequence at Moscow. The interval block was predictable.The second half again twists and turns but also there were some situations of questions such as how this character all of a sudden came into picture, how this thing happened which was one of the drawbacks.Yuvan music was pathetic. Whistle Podu song which was enjoyed by hearing on YouTube but what last minute changes made thereby spoiled the mood.De aging was good but turned out to worst when they portrayed the youngest VIJAY.Climax portion with SivaKarthikeyan cameo, music of Mankatha was awesome.END CREDITS gives hopes of Thalapathy rethinking his decision of quitting films.Overall , GOAT delivers what you expect from a Vijay Film but doesn't deliver what a film lover wants.\", \"Movie is too good\\nUnexpected twist comparing to vp previous movies this one is too good\\nFather vijay acting is another level\\nYuvan Shankar Raja scored in background music\\nAnd also matta song treat for everyone\\nVenkat prabhu proved he's a pure talentedWe no need Leo 2\\nWe need goat 2.Prashanth acting prabhu deva Mohan once again they proved they are acting.De aging perfectly worked Venkat Prabhu done is role perfectly\\nDon't try to believe anyone negative reviews try to watch in theatre\\nFor all of u def treat\\nCSK vs MI thala dhoni they are showing tht went another level crazeFor me 10 out of 10.\", \"This movie will get on your nerves, its soo bad but not at all surprised coz the movie is exactly what the trailer showed so the expectations were already low.The plot is too predictable but thats ok but the worst part is the vfx the de-ageing soo bad that it looks like snapchat filter at times. The movie was ok in the first half it managed to convey the emotions and some plot twist worked but no solid backstory for that. Overall the movie would have been great if it was made a decade ago coz we are too familiar with this plot and they copied the concept from Gemini man.I would have given 4 star if they would have stopped the movie before the end credit scene, coz that end credit scene is the most dumb part of this movie and i hope they don't make a sequel.\", 'Mind blowing and Incredible flim.

The length of the movie is the big drawback,playing for 3 hours where audience felt uncomfortable sitting and watching. Nowadays everyone started seeing world class movies in OTT and become matured, but these type of movies are still het released with old screenplay and story by just adding new technologies. Background score is another drawback in which the music was below average and songs are not even necessary for this story. Overall, this movie may be entertained for FDFS fans where they can celebrate their hero and there are many asuch scenes for die hard fans to celebrate. Rest assured lets wait for thalapathys next movie.\", \"Sometimes I wonder if these so called superstars are even remotely smart. How do they choose such scripts? I wouldn't call them actors, I would call them Entertainers and bad ones at that. Just adding a bunch of forgotten stars to the cast wont save a bad script and not tk mention absolutely cringe acting. The Wigs on Vijay were so hilarious to watch. Does he not realise that they make him look like a woman? Those wigs were probably made by some amateur. Vijay can't act, that we know but can't he just stop ham acting for once? Venkat Prabhu probably thought this was a masterpiece but it was trash. He should learn from small time directors and come back and try again.\", \"The title is very apt for this movie.

Top of that they are planning a sequel for this sh#tty picture. He is a good actor, we love his work in Leo but this time, I don't know what happened to him, literally made a mess in the name of film.And the background music is too loud for no reason.

I mean I understand the over the top action, but a spy joking while blowing up a train? Who he think he is? Deadpool?This is not a science fiction film. It is a typical south movie you watch on YT hindi dubbed. I don't know where they spent 400cr budget.\", \"This flick's got a bit of a mix, innit? Some bits of the story are quite good, but a fair few are a bit daft.The screenplay's got a few decent scenes here and there, but some parts just don't sit right.A couple of plot twists are proper clever, while others fall flat on their face.Seems like the director was having a go at copying that Hollywood action movie style-bit too much, if you ask me.We've got a few cameo turns from some big names, Dhoni looking up in the cricket ground and Trisha popping up for a peppy dance are the best of the lot.As for Thalapathy Vijay and the rest of the cast, they've given it a fair shot, bless 'em.But the cinematography? Not much to write home about.The music doesn't hit the mark either.And that de-aging tech? Looks a bit like it's been done on a budget, mate.All in all, it's a bit of alright if you're a die-hard Vijay fan, but don't expect too much, yeah?\", \"The film was a very entertaining watch. It has its moments and they did their best with the budget they had, Venkat Prabhu definitely made another creative storyline that suits Vijay. Him living a double life as a family man and spy agent is a unique thing for the south indian cinema, VP certainly pulled it off right. I really liked the Vijay double acting as Jeevan the son and Gandhi the father, both of them are very different characters and don't feel like they're played by the same exact person. Interval was amazing with the first half setting up the bigger story and the second half being a thriller and action sequence. Even though the de-aging looked a bit off, it can be excused as its not a big problem, Vijay's performance was in my opinion very raw and natural, which is why he's at the top of Indian actors. Prabhu Deva and Prashanth being the two side characters and friends was also nice, seeing Prashanth back after a long time was a treat. Yuvan Shankar Raja didn't really make good songs, but his background score makes up for it, Mohan as the villain was also weird but the performance he gave was superb, he wasn't really much of a fight villain but rather a villain who uses their brains to beat the main hero, the plot twists were very nice and felt unpredictable.

Despite the slick production values and stylish promotions, the movie stumbles in crucial aspects, making it a forgettable watch.One of the biggest downfalls of \"GOAT\" is its reliance on style over substance. The director seems more focused on presenting cool moments and visual gimmicks rather than developing a meaningful story. It feels like the filmmakers forgot that a good movie requires more than just a glossy exterior; it needs heart, nuance, and a compelling narrative.The film\\'s runtime, too, is unnecessarily stretched, making it a patience-testing affair. The climax, which should have been the film\\'s high point, ends up being predictable and unconvincing, leaving the audience underwhelmed.Vijay despite his efforts, is bogged down by poorly written dialogues and a lackluster character arc. Supporting actors, too, are given little to do, with most characters reduced to mere caricatures. Even seasoned actors are wasted in roles that don\\'t require their caliber.In conclusion, \"GOAT\" had the potential to be a solid entertainer but is marred by its lack of focus, over-reliance on gimmicks, and a hollow script. It\\'s a visually appealing but emotionally empty experience, leaving viewers craving for more depth and genuine storytelling. If you\\'re looking for style with little substance, \"GOAT\" might be worth a watch, but if you seek a well-rounded film, this one might not be for you.', \"You shouldn't be expecting a logic in a commercial movie especially when it is big hero movie. But still the logic is a big miss in Goat on several occasions. Goat is the worst VP movie not considering (Manmatha Leelai and Custody). VP failed big in writing and rather took the run time with too much reference, cameos and nostalgic moments. Vijay deserved better penultimate movie. This movie is not a theatre material, can be a tough/time pass watch in OTT. Cricket stadium scenes looked like a spoof with full of nonsensical scenes. Poor visuals , VFX , Music, Songs. Negative role done by Vijay didn't give any impact. Vijay as Gandhi did well, other than that nothing good in this illogical cringefest .Greatest of All Time - Greatness can't be defined if the word just added in the title.\", 'VP and team gave a perfect tribute to Vijay, Old story and but well made action entertainment. Movie starts very well just 10 mins lagged then again movie picked up so fast. Vijay is the show stealer as a Father and son,he proved that he can do negative shade. Mohan character could have wrote better as a senior actor his character is very limited. Prashant and other characters are well utilizes. Surprise Cameo was really good and not even bored. Matta song was just awesome in theatre. Action scenes are well made, especially interval block and climax was mind-blowing. Climax Thala reference was completely shock when Mangatha music came scene was goosebumps. A perfect theatre material we can watch with family.', \"The movie is off , it's a wasted opportunity was wasted as Vijay's last movie and cameos were wasted , he music placements were very off and weird , The 1st half\\nof the movie was very lag and dragged with unnecessary comedy ,the movie had too many plot twists which was unnecessary. The overall positives of the movie was Vijay's acting and action sequences .The movie's bgm did not work. I felt the movie was very pushed and the pacing was slow in the 1st half and whereas in the 2nd half the pacing was fast and rushed ,and had predictable story.

Best factor in my opinion. - 9/10Characters + Script was awesome. All characters were perfect, actors fit their role, some lines were a bit corny and cringy but the rest was nice - 8/10Cons:\\nMusic was really not that good, most common issue was instrumentals and pitch would not match the singing. BGM was very good, though. - 4/10CGI in some scenes was very bad, very easy to tell in some scenes, some other scenes also showed a slightly visible green screen outline amongst characters. Other scenes were great. - 3/10.Speed was overall good, but some parts were too dragged too fast. - 4.5/10Overall, a must watch movie with a great balance of action. Thrill, romance and emotion.

It was done so badly.Expected something great from VP.Thanks.\", \"Yes, Vijay's GOAT will be a cloned trail. It was a good try in the VP's film career and VJ too. The screenplay of the flick was scratchy and not creepy with the outline. It could've been better if that outline was handled by a suitable screenplay. VP did magic in representing young Vijay with the old one. It worked well. Yuvan BGM was not engaging. It sounds as if it was scored for a namesake. Two songs were good there which were a dance number in the highlight. VJ holds the whole flick with his charisma. All other characters have scored in some places but didn't stand well throughout the flick. One-time watchable.\", \"In the high-octane world of Indian cinema, Vijay's GOAT emerges as a standout spectacle, weaving together action, drama, and a powerful narrative. Directed by the visionary filmmaker, the movie captures the essence of what makes a film truly memorable: engaging storytelling, charismatic performances, and stunning visuals.Vijay, in his role as the titular GOAT, delivers a performance that is both electrifying and nuanced. His portrayal of a complex character grappling with internal and external conflicts is a testament to his versatility as an actor. Vijay's screen presence is magnetic, effortlessly drawing the audience into the emotional and thrilling journey of his character.The film's plot is a masterclass in pacing and intrigue. It skillfully balances intense action sequences with moments of deep, personal reflection. The storyline, while familiar in its broad strokes, is given a fresh twist through its innovative direction and sharp screenplay. The dialogue is crisp and impactful, adding depth to the characters and their motivations.Visually, GOAT is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography is striking, with each frame meticulously crafted to enhance the overall experience. The action scenes are well-choreographed and exhilarating, while the quieter moments are handled with a delicate touch that underscores the film's emotional core.The supporting cast also deserves a mention for their stellar performances. They complement Vijay's lead role perfectly, adding layers to the story and enriching the overall narrative. The soundtrack is another highlight, with a score that resonates long after the credits roll, enhancing both the high-energy sequences and the more intimate scenes.Overall, GOAT is a triumphant addition to Vijay's filmography. It combines thrilling action with a compelling story and strong performances, making it a must-watch for fans of Indian cinema and action films alike. The movie's ability to engage on multiple levels ensures that it will be remembered as a high point in Vijay's illustrious career.\", \"One of the worst movies ever of Joseph Vijay. The plot of the movie is so predictable. It's a movie for just diehard fans and nothing in this. It feels like a turbulent flight with many twists but not working and very predictable. Inclusion of many characters which were not needed. It felt more a spoof than a real movie. Music of this movie doesn't feel good enough. Background scores are somewhat good in some scenes. The movie is so long with moderate content although some of the supporting cast were good and justified their characters. Makeup and some scenes with AI made it more like spoof. Vijay did what he can but plot was not good enough.Some action sequences were very interesting.Comedy is too average. The climax is the main highlight of this movie which made this movie a worst experience. Nothing new and masala at its peak. Screenplay is somewhat okay.

I was excited but my excitement was lost with the first 20 mins. He has done much better movies including sura and puli is much much better than this movie.

There are so many capable actors out there cmon.random and unnecessary graphical parts.simple details like how characters are shown to age or how the timing of how one character shows up in another location, is all poorly thought out as it is highly illogical.

Yuvan Shankar Raja's background score, especially during the climax, is disappointing and noisy. Mohan's character, despite him returning as a villain after 30 years, is underutilized and not memorable.Overall, it's a light, feel-good family entertainer, and Vijay delivers a decent experience without heavy moments-perfect for a relaxing time at the movies with your family.\", 'Plot Summary:\\n\"GOAT\" tries to establish itself as a gripping thriller, but unfortunately, it ends up more like a timid lamb in the grand arena of Tamil cinema. The protagonist, meant to symbolize the \"Greatest of All Time\" (GOAT), embarks on a mission of vengeance, wrapped in mystery and betrayal. The story follows the familiar thriller path of personal loss, revenge, and dark conspiracies, but it struggles to live up to the metaphor of being the GOAT.Review:\\nThe term GOAT carries immense weight-just like how we call Messi the GOAT for his unmatched prowess, this movie fails to deliver that same kind of excellence. Instead of being a standout thriller that grips you with every twist and turn, \"GOAT\" falters with a weak plotline and underwhelming character development. The pacing drags, and what could have been a riveting exploration of human grit and determination turns into a predictable affair.Despite the director\\'s efforts to create tension, much of the film feels clich√©d, with over-the-top sequences and melodramatic moments that reduce its impact. The hero\\'s journey feels forced, and the script doesn\\'t provide enough depth to justify the \"GOAT\" title. A few interesting moments do exist, but they are too few and far between to save the movie from mediocrity.Positives:A couple of well-executed action sequences\\nDecent performances by the lead and antagonist\\nGood cinematography, especially in darker, intense scenesNegatives:\\nWeak and predictable storyline\\nFails to justify the \"GOAT\" metaphor, turning the lead into a mere mortal\\nOverdramatic sequences that take away from the intended suspense\\nLack of memorable dialogues and character arcs\\nFinal Verdict:\\n\"GOAT\" sets high expectations with its title, but like calling Messi the GOAT and then watching him fumble through a match, the movie just doesn\\'t deliver. What could have been an intense thriller ends up as a forgettable flick.

The storyline starts well and it seems interesting in the beginning but as soon as 30 mins pass the plot becomes super obvious. The characters are smiling in scenes where they need to hide their identity and so called officers are useless. They don't have weapon to use, no idea if they have someone in the team leaking their information. South indian movies have great plots usually but such commercial movies have become just that.

T. because his masterclass in playing double role. The most unexpected thing was Jeevan's character and I literally loved his character. The opening scene was not that good but the Interval Block and Climax killed it. In short it is a nice mass film with a pinch of Venkat Prabhu's Class. The major flaw of film is VFX which I expected could be better. The songs were below average but dance of Vijay Anna was again G. O. A. T.

Makes sense why kids will like it because of the random crap happening throughout the movie so they will get their dopamine hits while us adults get the negative effects.

Vijay is my favourite tamil actor but this wasn't it. The music wasnt great and felt outdated. The first half i was actually interested highlighted by performances by Vijay and Sneha, it had a good amount of action humour and emotions. 2nd half is where it starts to take a major step back. The de aging didnt look bad but a lot of the background CGI was subpar. The deaged Vijay seemed just a bit too goofy and was leaning towards being jus excessive and overperformative. Scenes that should be serious and emotional would turn into this awkward try at humour. The ending felt weirdly rushed and stretched at the same time. I appreciate them trying some new stuff but the Deaged Character felt very two dimensional and not fleshed out or explained properly at all.

Whistle podu song was another disappointment, watching Prabhudeva and prashant dance next to Vijay and Vijay steps are not as much as his early songs like Thanjavur Jillakari or Appadi Podu. The return of Trisha in Matte song was like Gilli again. But these are all the fireworks.The 2nd Half was not connecting well with the first half l. And the climax was so lengthy.All in all the director made a \"Goat\" out of Vijay, disrespecting his dedication to his films. Vijay sir, please select good directors and stories.

It\\'s hard to recommend this film even to die-hard Vijay fans, who deserve much better from their favorite actor.', \"It has a very good first half, an extraordinary second half, and a climax.Probably a Top 15 Thalapathy FILM.Vijay went full-on psycho mode in terms of playing both roles.Screenplay is Fast and Crisp - The story is a bit usual but the amount of plot twists and shock factors makes the story stand out.Amazing Acting from Prashanth, Prabhu Deva, Sneha\\nDo not expect it to be like Maanadu - It is more like a Mankatha Type.VP delivered and this is in his Top 3 along with Mankatha and Maanaadu\\nIts just people here are jealous of Vijay in general - can point out by just comparing this to their fav actor's film.One of the Best Commerical Tamil Films of 2024.\", '**Goat Movie Review**\"Goat\" is, unfortunately, one of the most disappointing South Indian movies I\\'ve seen in recent times. From the lack of logic to the absence of a coherent storyline, this film is a mess from start to finish. The plot makes little sense, leaving the audience questioning every scene, and the SATS officer, a central character, is portrayed as a complete dumbass, which is both frustrating and unrealistic.The movie starts off on a promising note, with a few engaging scenes and some decent action sequences, but that\\'s where the positives end. As soon as the initial excitement fades, it becomes clear that there\\'s nothing to look forward to. The lack of suspense and poor pacing make it feel more like a cheap school play rather than a big-budget production.Ultimately, \"Goat\" is a complete waste of time. It tries to pass off a few fight scenes as entertainment, but without a meaningful storyline or any gripping moments, it fails miserably. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.', \"8.5k top reviews!!!???? Seriously? This questions the credibility of imdb ratings. If I could file legal case against the makers of this movie, especially the director, for wasting my two hours I would do that. I mean, does he take us for no brainers Or is he one himself glorified in Vijay wrap paper! It's such a shame this film, especially one that's supposed to give Vijay his grand exit. Yes, I enjoyed the Easter eggs but goodness, what a waste of a movie. More so, an insult to human intelligence and emotions. And catching MSDs eye roll was heights. The director of this movie are the kind of people who inspire violence, at least with one tight slap! And he is not done yet! Take my word. Respect yourself and your family time and DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE!\", 'One of the worst storyline in Tamil cinema.Movie from beginning to end was a complete disaster.Illogical script , average screenplay and worst direction.Only saving grace is acting from Vijay and Sneha..\\nI wonder how come Vijay agree to do this kind of movie...\\nAfter Bijil I was expecting some strong storyline but GOAT was a complete let down. How can one make movie around son revolting against father without even knowing the reason for grudge.Either director was clueless or he thought just by casting Vijay everything will fly....\\nVijay is a fine actor but he needs to be very careful while choosing script as audience nowadays look for substance and not just big starcast.Prabu was good. Prashant needs to see what kind of characters suits him .Director did not do justice with Mohan and his acting skills...', 'The movie *GOAT* starring Vijay is an exceptional cinematic experience that captivates audiences with its powerful storyline, dynamic performances, and edge-of-the-seat action sequences. Vijay delivers a stellar performance, blending his trademark charisma with a deeper emotional depth that adds layers to his character. The direction is sharp, and the screenplay is well-paced, keeping viewers engaged from start to finish. With high-octane fight scenes, catchy music, and a strong supporting cast, *GOAT* offers a perfect balance of mass entertainment and thoughtful storytelling, making it a must-watch for Vijay fans and cinephiles alike.', 'The first sci-fic movie from thalapathy vijay career...............The villanisam thapathy nailed it.

Keep going thapathy vijay.. next level of dance he is unstoppable.#Yuvan\\'s background score is on point, especially with a remix of an old #Ilaiyaraja song that makes you want to dance. Plus, the Bhavatharini track \"Chinna Chinna Kangal,\" made with AI, is really touching and soulful.', \"Although it had a captivating and promising beginning, it quickly turned into a film that only threw in a few masala sequences one after another for the sake of fan service. It was not distinctive in any way. I know this was done on purpose for the fans, but it really did not measure up to the expectations I had for the film. It was like watching the same thing we have been seeing for years-the same sentiments, jokes, and punch lines. With this film, Venkat Prabhu has truly let us down after directing such a fantastic film as Manadu. At best, the plot was mediocre. The de aging process was pitiful.The music was very loud. Vijay's popularity is the only explanation for why this film is able to run. With the acting, he has really excelled. It is obvious that this is a one-man performance because he spends the entire picture carrying the movie on his back. The story's writing is dreadful. It seemed just like three hours of nonstop reel watching. The scenes have no connection at all. One strange event after another just keeps happening. Lacks a meaningful backstory. The villain was a poor choice. I wish they had chosen someone with a stronger sense of self.\", \"Thalapathy Vijay sir gave such a fantastic performance as Gandhi and Jeevan, in both roles he perfectly excels!!Meenakshi Chaudhary is absolutely beautiful, wished she had more screen time but she gave a decent performance! She looked so hot in Spark song!!Prabhudheva sir is great!! Fantastic actor and dancer!The villain who's played by Mohan, he's really good but his character kinda gave me the vibes of the villain from Beast! Wished his character was written a bit better.Music was good by Yuvan Shankar Raja, Spark song was so bad that it was intentionally funny with weird choreography and lyrics! But Meenakshi looked so hot in that song. And the very beautiful, talented and insanely gorgeous beauty Trisha ma'am's cameo in the song Matta, Such a beauty she is!!The only question that's on my mind is how the makers will do a sequel of the film which is announced towards the end of the movie when Thalapathy Vijay sir has announced his retirement from the film industry! The sequel is most likely impossible to even happen!But GOAT is a well made entertaining movie!! Loved it totally!!\", 'This Movie is one of the best movies i have ever seen but i bet everyone almost everyone has loved the the movie so much that even vijay(gandhi in movie) has been suprised that so much of us loved it. Sk was a special apperence but even though he had less time he did from comedy to action love this guy bro. Have u seen the other vijay he looks a bit wierd but acting amazing of him doing double action . Akill was a good actor for his age limit . This beated my expetaion of all kinds .The real G. O. A.

But for commercial movie fans,this is definitely a must one time watch. Personally I feel one drawback isWeakest writing of Gandhi Vijay character who had working in SATS team with no intelligence.Other than that major positives are3 songs with extraordinary dance of VijaySmall twists & engaging screenplay in 2nd halfPost-Climax with a suspenseSK CameoDecent work of De-ageing TechnologyNo smoking scenesMany movie referencesFinally our Thalapathy acting.\", \"Screenplay: Jumps from one scene to another like a Kangaroo.Comedy: I don't have very high standards of comedy and this was much lower.CGI: The CGI scenes were the real comedy.Looks like TN people can be entertained cheaply. The cheapness of the direction felt too cringy and I couldn't watch it beyond 30 mins. I think Beast is better than this! Yes, that's how terrible this one is.Also, if you're an avid watcher of Hollywood movies, you'll lose count after a while as to how many scenes they've copied. Even then, they ended up making the most cringey version of those scenes.Do yourself a favour and stay away from this one.\", \"What a lagging movie! It is something worse than a TV serial where the common sense amd patience of audience is being tested. Why Vijay is acting for such third rate stories and movies, I don't understand.

Ill probably have to continue watching telegu, malyalam, korean, french movies.', \"PERFORMANCE:\\nThalapathy Vijay is the heart and soul of the film. His magnetic screen presence, razor-sharp dialogue delivery, and action sequences are tailor-made for his fan base. Vijay brings both intensity and vulnerability to his role, effortlessly switching between emotional scenes and high-octane action. His dance numbers, a staple in his movies, are a visual treat, with foot-tapping music that blends well with the overall mood of the film.VERDICT\\nGreatest of All Time lives up to its title in many ways, especially for Thalapathy Vijay's fans. It is an action-packed, emotion-filled entertainer that plays to Vijay's strengths and gives the audience what they expect from a superstar of his caliber. Though it follows a conventional formula, the film's execution and Vijay's performance make it a must-watch for anyone who enjoys mass entertainers with heart.\", 'A movie that minted money at the box office but received a barrage of negative reviews. I had zero expectations going in and watched it just to see how bad it could be. The very first scene of the movie gives you the answer.An agent and his team from the Special Anti-Terrorism Squad undertake a mission, killing everyone involved. This leads to a disruption in his life, as his son dies as a result, and he retreats to a quiet, ordinary life-only to find himself once again facing the wrath of those connected to the mission he completed.You can\\'t review the story because, sadly, the makers seem to have forgotten to write one. They stitched random scenes together and called it a movie. If you look for logic here, you\\'ll only have yourself to blame. The film throws twists at you from many angles, most of which you can guess from miles away, though a few unexpected turns do work.This movie is solely made to worship Vijay. He is in literally every scene. You grow tired of seeing him, especially when he plays the younger version of himself, which feels outdated. Prabhudeva delivers in terms of acting and looks, while Prasanth is decent but not fit, making him almost unrecognizable. Sneha is good in her small role, but Meenakshi Chaudhary, used merely as eye candy, doesn\\'t fit the part either as an actor or as eye candy. Jayaram and Yogi Babu are completely wasted in this mess, and the series of cameos adds no value.The whole technical expertise seems to have been focused on de-aging Vijay, which turned caricaturish and made him a laughing stock. There are plenty of action scenes, some decent, but the sheer number of them diminishes their impact. The songs are terrible, and the choreography, aside from the recreation of the \"Ghilli\" step with Trisha, is disappointing. There\\'s literally a scene where an actress asks why she\\'s been called, and the answer is: \"For a song.\" The scene abruptly breaks into a dance number, ending it with no connection to the previous scene. Even the VFX work is poor, especially the entire fight sequence on the stadium roof during the climax.At one point, they use the Mission Impossible BGM, and it\\'s clear they attempted to copy the stunts but failed miserably. With a headache-inducing runtime of 3 hours, this movie isn\\'t worth a dime. There\\'s no good reason to endure this torture called The GOAT. We could be glad there is just one last movie left of Vijay we have to bear with.#pranureviews #TheGreatestOfAllTime #TheGreatestOfAllTimeReview #TheGreatestOfAllTimeTamil.', \"THE GOAT,\\nThis film is a high-octane entertainer that delivers a thrilling cinematic experience from start to finish. Thalapathy Vijay's electrifying performance, especially in his action-packed sequences, is a standout, captivating fans and showcasing his star power. The fast-paced first half, with its unexpected twists and an impressive interval block, keeps viewers on the edge of their seats, while Yuvan Shankar Raja's explosive background score enhances the intensity throughout. The film's Hollywood-level production values and its relentless energy make it a rollercoaster ride that sets up an even more exciting second half, leaving fans eagerly awaiting what comes next.\", 'I will dive right into positives first. Movie is filled with great pace and little surprises here and there making it entertaining. Then, Vijay screen presence makes it much more engaging in scenes where directions lies flat. But it did not seem enough.All the twists become very predictable because of how the movie was promoted, as Young vs Old thalapathy. Though I am not a tamil speaking guy, I knew this point watching the trailer itself. No other promotions or interviews. Audience (myself) might definitely feel the movie dragged in such revealing scenes. For almost all the reveals, I was like \"Yeah, young thalapathy, I can see him, why hide, skip. Skip. SKIP.\" It would had been atleast good if BGM was set to elevate tense mood. Leave about bgm in family moments, it really does not sync in there. Finally, the VFX. Though it is great for the standards, it fails to capture Vijay\\'s expressions/transitions by keeping eyes always open. I do not really remember seeing young Vijay blinking anywhere, making it feel way unnatural.', \"The best thing in this movie is Vijay Thalapathy.

The attention to detail in the production design further enhances the film\\'s immersive quality.The film\\'s soundtrack, composed by Yuan plays a crucial role in enhancing the emotional and dramatic elements of the story. The music is both evocative and energizing, with tracks that resonate with the themes of the film. The songs are well-integrated into the narrative, providing both a sonic backdrop to the action and a deeper emotional connection to the characters.In addition to Vijay\\'s stellar performance, the supporting cast delivers strong contributions that add depth to the film. Their chemistry with Vijay is palpable, creating a dynamic that enriches the storyline.The film\\'s themes are both timeless and timely, exploring concepts of heroism, sacrifice, and redemption. \"GOAT\" manages to address these themes in a way that feels fresh and relevant, prompting viewers to reflect on the moral and ethical dilemmas faced by the characters.

A sniper is perched on a hill, targeting a train, and stays in the same position for over four minutes (yes, that's how long the scene drags on). I'm not sure which hill offers a panoramic view of the entire planet, but apparently, this one does. I won't even get into the rest of the fight sequence, let's just say they used Instagram or Snapchat filters for the VFX, clearly inspired by Mission Impossible.The secret room entry is made through what looks like a basic biometric attendance device.

Gandhi's SATS team constitutes of Sunil Thiagarajan (Prashanth), Kalyan Sundaram (Prabhudeva), Ajay (Ajmal Ameer) and their boss Nazeer (Jayaram). On a work-cation trip to Thailand, an unpleasant incident changes his life and his approach to work. Cut to 17 years, Gandhi is now an immigration officer, who spends his days stamping passports, and taking care of his daughter who lives with his wife. The couple are separated.

On one hand, it was packed with action, drama, and various subplots, all happening simultaneously. However, on the other hand, the ending was rather straightforward and predictable. Furthermore, the film\\'s length and inclusion of some unnecessary scenes made it feel a bit exhausting at times. In many ways, it adhered closely to the typical formula of a Tamil mass movie.One aspect of \"THe GOAT\" that truly stood out was its remarkable cinematography. The visuals were nothing short of spectacular, with breathtaking shots and stunning scenery that captivated the audience throughout the film. The use of modern technology in the production added a contemporary touch, making the movie feel relevant and in tune with the times. It was evident that the filmmakers had invested a considerable amount of effort and resources into crafting a visually stunning experience.The casting for \"THe GOAT \" was another highlight for me. The ensemble of actors brought their A-game to the table, delivering compelling performances that resonated with the audience. The chemistry between the cast members felt genuine, and their portrayals of their respective characters were convincing. It\\'s not often that you find a movie where you can genuinely appreciate all the casting choices, but managed to achieve just that.Now, despite these positive aspects, there were some notable downsides to the film. As mentioned earlier, the sheer length of the movie was a bit daunting. At times, it felt like certain scenes were included for the sake of prolonging the runtime rather than adding significant value to the storyline. This made the viewing experience a bit tedious, and I found myself wishing for a more concise narrative.Additionally, the plot of THe GOAT followed a rather predictable trajectory. It adhered closely to the conventions of a typical Tamil mass movie, complete with the hero\\'s journey, action-packed sequences, and larger-than-life villains. While this formula has its merits and can be enjoyable, it does run the risk of feeling formulaic. I would have appreciated a bit more innovation or a fresh perspective on this genre.However, despite these shortcomings, \"THe GOAT\" managed to keep me engaged primarily due to its impressive visuals and the cast\\'s stellar performances. The action sequences were adrenaline-pumping, and the emotional moments were heartfelt. The film did evoke a sense of nostalgia for fans of the genre, as it paid homage to the classic elements that have defined Tamil mass cinema over the years.In conclusion, \"THe GOAT\" is a film that falls somewhere in between. While it may not break new ground in terms of storytelling or genre conventions, it compensates for this with its stunning cinematography and outstanding cast. If you\\'re a fan of Tamil mass movies and can overlook a somewhat lengthy runtime and predictable plot, you\\'ll likely find \"THe GOAT\" to be an enjoyable cinematic experience. For me, it earns a solid 9/10 rating, thanks to its visual brilliance and strong performances.', \"The effects were horrible and Vijay's acting as Jeevan was also horrible. The get up was even worse.

I wonder when is Vijay going tp do realistic movie other than saving someone, which he started since Gilli. Whole story was easily guessable. The movie was typically made to showcase heroism of Vijay. That's it. Waiting for a new heroic movie from the hero again.\", 'The movie is with same vijay formula and worst making. No elevation, no swag, no good bgm neither songs. Graphics part is utter waste. Felt like game graphics is far better than this movie. When u sitting totally crigified cameo will be coming. Iyo jst after that u will realise that u have wasted 200rs and 3h of time of ur life.There is no reason to watch it. If you feeling depressed watch and understand there are failures than you. Big salute to all people who watched completetly. SK part is the crigest scene in the movie. Cant even imagine what they will do the in the second part. Hopping it wont happen!!!!', \"One of the best Vijay movies in current years. Vijay double act was awesome, especially the young Vijay, that character that they build was insane. This movie songs got a lot of improvement compared to YouTube version. Bgm also in satisfactory level. There are a lot of scenes was used with CGI and VFX, becoz some scenes with them are glitchy, which was a big negative, but don't expect this about VFX and logic. It's just pure entertainment. First half was filled with fun elements, while second half was filled with twist and turns. There are unexpected cameos which was lite. And even side characters was good. And last but not least, the title card was insane.\", \"My rating would be less but 5/10\\nfirst half of the movie is not good at all. It seems some new director made this part. Story goes falt and bore me.After 50-55min movie starts to grip on story and it seems movie deserves a solid 7/10\\nBut,\\nThe climax, what a bad climax it was.It could have been good but they failed to make it GOAT. I had expectations.Story: 4/10 (It was extremely open and predicatble for me that Prabhu Deva character, or Young Vijay or even the twist. Everything was in from of me.)Music: I can't say anything since I didn't listen it. As I was watching a dub version.Acting: 4/10 (Young Vijay and Prabhu Deva bad bad\\nDirection: 3/10 bro 3/10. You had everything to make this movie real great and you failed.Conclusion: This movie has nothing to expect. Watch it if you can. My suggestion is to avoid.This movie is more like a TV movie, you have nothing to do, play it and sit, go, sleep, work do anything. This movie is that.Remark : once a huge fan of vijay, because of him I started watching Tamil films. Today.. my excietment died for him since Marshal.\", \"I consider myself someone who can sit through even the worst films, but this movie tested every ounce of that resilience. From the very beginning, it became a GOAT-level disaster that I simply couldn't bear. Despite my efforts to fast-forward through the worst parts, even that didn't help, and halfway through, I had to give up. The film left me with an actual headache, which is rare for me.To put it mildly, the visual effects (VFX) are atrocious-unbelievably poor for modern standards. The screenplay felt like it was patched together last minute, with zero flow or coherence. Add to that the equally bad acting, and you have a recipe for disaster. Every scene was either cringeworthy or felt out of place.In summary, this is, without a doubt, one of the greatest flops of all time. Do yourself a favor and avoid it. Watch something like Ninja Hattori instead, which, despite its quirks, would be a much more entertaining experience compared to this.\", 'Here\\'s a revised version with over 600 characters:\"Just watched *Greatest of All Time* starring Vijay, and I must say, it was nothing short of spectacular! Vijay\\'s performance truly shines-he brings a perfect mix of charisma, intensity, and heartfelt emotion to every scene, reminding us why he\\'s hailed as \\'Thalapathy.\\' The storyline is gripping from start to finish, with the perfect balance of action, drama, and suspense that keeps you hooked. The direction and cinematography were absolutely brilliant, capturing every moment with artistic precision. The supporting cast did an amazing job, and the soundtrack was powerful, heightening the emotions of every key scene. *Greatest of All Time* is not just a movie; it\\'s an experience. Vijay once again proves that he\\'s a master of his craft. If you\\'re a fan of cinema or a die-hard Vijay admirer, this is a must-watch film that will leave you thoroughly impressed!\"', 'This movie is about Gandhi, a Special Anti-Terrorism Squad (SATS) Agent who goes on a mission undercover with his family on vacation. The turns of events made him quit SATS and live an ordinary life. Years after his past comes to take revenge on him and his fellow SATS Agents.The movie has the potential to be made as a great action thriller, but Venkat Prabhu didn\\'t write a compelling story with proper scenes, twists, and turns. The movie heavily resembles \"Gemini Man\" in outline. The movie runs for 3 hours, which is too long duration to tell this movie, but it is engaging most of the time. The fight sequences seem good. The main villain, Menon, is not written well enough because he is not as intimidating as Sanjay. There are more flaws to tell about this film, but I couldn\\'t remember things much from it, which proves how lame this movie was.After \"Maanaadu (2021)\", I had expectations of Venkat Prabhu to give another good entertainer but was let down by this movie. He should worked more on the script instead of trying to place cameos and references to his and Vijay\\'s previous films, etc. Vijay did a great job in the character \\'Jeevan\\', and it was the only comforting thing in the movie. Other artists did justice to their roles even though they had no scope in character to show their excellence. The background music was mediocre; I didn\\'t expect this from Yuvan Shanker Raja (He did a good job in \\'Maanaadu\\', even in \\'Garudan\\'). The songs were lame too. The De-aging looks unnecessary as the output is poor in the film; instead, they cast Vijay\\'s son for his younger role in the flashback scene, which could been a useful cameo.In conclusion, I didn\\'t like this movie much, but if you want to watch this movie despite the flaws, then okay, don\\'t expect it to entertain you well.', 'Actor Vijay Joseph tries to recreate the mystique of Rajnikanth type plot, but fails miserably. All the standard pot boiler ingredients are added. Lookalike of Vijayakanth, political messages (he is reported to be starting a political party to spite ruling anti Sanatan Dharma), zero presence of actresses, impossible stunts. Sitting through the film for 3 long hours became an ordeal.Perhaps, this appeals more to hysterical fans who destroy theatre properties on the first day, first show. Where are are Tamil movies heading towards. The make up of old and young Vijay looks unconvincing. The permanent disheveled hair look is irritating. As usual these larger than life movies try to keep a window for a sequel. I will surely avoid that dose of masochism.', '\"The Greatest of All Time\" is an entertaining film with enough moments to keep you engaged, but it doesn\\'t escape certain flaws. The movie\\'s strength lies in its performances, particularly by Prashanth, who brings depth to his character. Vijayakanth\\'s presence adds excitement, but unfortunately, both their CGI-enhanced younger versions are a major letdown. The graphics feel outdated and awkward, disrupting the flow in key scenes.Despite these technical issues, \"The Greatest of All Time\" still manages to provide solid entertainment. The predictable plot won\\'t blow you away, and the visual effects could have been much better, but it\\'s the strong performances and emotional moments that keep the film afloat. For casual viewers looking for a fun, feel-good experience, this movie does the job.It may not be groundbreaking, but \"The Greatest of All Time\" is a one-time must-watch for fans of Tamil cinema and those who enjoy light, engaging entertainment. Just don\\'t expect to be wowed by the visuals.This version keeps it concise, framing the film as an enjoyable one-time watch despite its shortcomings.', 'Best commercial Film\\nNo boring\\nTight screenplay\\nLot of twist\\nLast 40 mins Movie goes in a jet speed.Vijay steal the show and Yuvan rocksNew version of Thalapathy Unlocked.The way Vijay acted in the film and Venkat Prabhu Directed was awesome.In the film vijay plays dual role and in the climax There is an out of syllabus twist which will blow ur mind.Co actors also mailed it.Slight VFX Problem in some scenes\\nOverall its a Best outing for both of them.Usual twist but revealed in unexpected timings.Typical Venkat Prabhu blast\\nIlayathalapthy Rocks\\nWorth it go and give a try\\nI bet u will never be disappointed.', \"Vijay's latest film, GOAT, is nothing short of a mega blockbuster that delivers on all fronts.

So feel free to laugh about it and bully me when we meet \\uf8ffüòÇ):Pros:Screenplay 10/10 (thalapathy entrances in each scene were amazing. And the movie's screenplay had me hooked so much that it didn't let me finish my packet of Crisps and my 50ml soda can)Action Sequences 8-9/10 (Thalapathy did amazing here and even other actors too. Venkat Prabhu's direction went really well with these. They just have the usual exaggerated fighting sequences which is normal in our Indian Industry lol)Fighting Choreograohy 10/10 (one of the best parts of the movie. Vijay's career best choreography. He did fantastically)VFX 6-7/10 (u can clearly see some not too good vfx but it wouldn't bother u much, but maybe this rating cuz I was expecting more)Comedy 9-10/10 (u will definitely find urself laughing, some sex jokes are made too lol)Vijay Acting 10/10 (we get to see his goofy side, emotional, serious, psycho etc. One of his career best acting)Background score 10/10 (no doubts needed. Yuvan proved us wrong when we doubted him. Movie wouldn't be the same without the backing score and it was AMAZING)Songs 8-9/10 (when we first listened nobody really liked it, but ur opinion will be changed when u watch it on screen. It's A WHOLE LOT better and Thalapathy dance in the last song was \\uf8ffüî•\\uf8ffüî•\\uf8ffüî•\\uf8ffüëå\\uf8ffüèΩ\\uf8ffüëå\\uf8ffüèΩ\\uf8ffüëå\\uf8ffüèΩeasily best dances in his recent movies.Cameos 9/10 (first cameo you'll see is not so great cuz AI was used instead of the real person. Every other cameo was a banger and some even unexpected)References to other movies 10/10 (they referenced like 20 movies, some of them not even Vijay's.)Easily TOP 4 Vijay movies. And illayathalapathy stope the show. Forget his ridiculous look, it suits his personality.It's more like a Venkat Prabhu film rather than a thalpathy film.Cons:1. Decent VFX2. First cameo was bad but respectable3. We get an AI thalapathy in one scene and it wasn't too great. Good try thoughOverall Movie Rating 8.5-9/10.But I'll give it 10/10 for the effort the team put into making the movie. It was a mass entertainer and can watch more than once. People expected too much from it and when the movie doesn't meet their expectations, it's marked as a bad movie by them. Go without expectations and it'll be nice treat with God Tier cinematic experience.\", \"Such a wonderful movie in all aspects.

Let celebrate the movie and everyone enjoy it.\", \"This movie is an extraordinary masterpiece that redefines cinema. Thalapathy Vijay, in his most compelling role to date, delivers a performance that is nothing short of legendary. His portrayal is powerful, charismatic, and emotionally charged, captivating the audience from start to finish. Every scene he's in is a testament to his unmatched talent and star power.Jeevan, playing a pivotal role, matches Vijay's intensity with a nuanced and gripping performance. He brings a level of depth and complexity to his character that adds layers to the story, making their on-screen dynamic truly electrifying.This film is not just a cinematic experience; it's a cultural phenomenon. It showcases the brilliance of Thalapathy Vijay and Jeevan, setting a new benchmark for excellence in filmmaking. From the opening scene to the final frame, it's a rollercoaster of emotions, leaving you exhilarated, moved, and utterly captivated.Simply put, this movie is a monumental achievement in cinema and deserves to be remembered as one of the greatest films of all time. If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out on a piece of cinematic history!\", \"GOAT movie is really awesome. Thalapathy looks very handsome and stylish. Each and every character did their role very perfectly. Yuvan's bgm feels very strong for the scenes with thalapathy's presence. Thalapathy's chemistry with two pairs, Sneha and Meenakshi, looks very good and perfect. Songs visuals are outstanding. Twists are really unpredictable and unexpected. Captain vijayakanth's character elevates the scene and it feels very nostalgic. Prashanth and Prabhu deva did their role very well. Being watching their movie in my childhood and now seeing all 3 together and dancing along was the best part. And lastly those cameos of Trisha and Sivakarthikeyan just boosts those 2 scenes.\", \"As the reigning real goat of Tamil cinema, he once again managed to drive his fans crazy..The fans love him so much..He is the only star who is number 1 in hearts.I don't know why.

Family audience welcome the movie in upcoming days.Cinematography, Action Choreography, Direction and All supporting cast were good.The main disappointment in the movie is YUVAN SANKAR RAJA !If the movie is receiving negative reviews, thats only because of Music and Background Score.', \"Still can't get out of that Jeevan Character. This one is really the greatest of all time. Waiting for OG vs THE GOAT.Entire movie is filled with fun action drama songs. Especially loved the humor in the beginning of the movie. Last 40 mins climax is s brilliant you cannot even blink your eyes. Thalapathy Vijay's acting is the biggest strength in this movie. Direction and screenplay is very good.

If Vijay returns to his cinematic career he must absolutely sign a sequel of this picture .Mass choreography, the Ai techonlogy of Captain Vijayakanth worked very well. All songs are chartbuster . A perfect commercial entertainer.Absolutely is not Venkat Prabhu Hero but Venkat Prabhu Villain.\", \"It's Ilayathalapathy versus Thalapathy. One is a good guy and the other is bad one. A young man vs an older one, bringing double the fun and double the action. Director Venkat Prabhu tries to show the audience why this film and Vijay is GOAT to his fans and the audience.GOAT takes off in Kenya in 2008 where we see a special anti-terrorist squad (SATS) team recover stolen uranium from a group of terrorists led by Omar and Rajiv Menon (Mohan). Gandhi (Vijay) and his team members-cum-friends Kalyan (Prabhu Deva), Sunil (Prashanth), Shaaam (Ajay) come back victorious to India but create havoc in the mission and receive flak from their chief Nazeer (Jayaram) for this. The group of men are thick as thieves and like to party and this is what gets Gandhi into trouble with his pregnant wife Anu (Sneha), who is quite suspicious of his activities.To keep Anu and his son Jeevan happy, Gandhi decides to take them to Thailand when he is assigned a mission. And this is where things go terribly wrong. Gandhi and his family are attacked by a gang and Anu ends up in hospital while Jeevan ends up kidnapped and killed. Cut to years later and we see things have changed - Gandhi is on a desk job and he is separated from Anu. But terror strikes again in the form of Sanjay. What does Gandhi do ? Who is Sanjay ? How does the SATS team save the day ? Does Gandhi reunite with his family ? Is it a happy-ever-after ?Director Venkat Prabhu must first be lauded for writing a story that travels the world and has family sentiment, action, humour and drama interlaced with twists and plenty of tributes. He has given Thalapathy Vijay a story that is quite different from the Tamil star's last few outings and it's refreshing. Vijay is seen in two roles and the two characters are radically quite different and that's what makes it interesting. Venkat Prabhu has loaded the film with a lot of tributes starting from Captain Vijayanath, SPB and Ajith's Mankatha hook step to his late cousin, Bhavatharini, and numerous Vijay films.The first half of GOAT is extremely engaging with the director setting up the stage for superb interval block that takes you by surprise. There is a lot of family drama and high-octane action in various missions around the world before the film hits the interval. Post interval, the film takes off with a face off between the Gandhi and Sanjay and the director tries to keep it fast-paced. Through the film, Venkat Prabhu shows he is a fanboy of Vijay, the Kollywood (references to Ghilli, Thirumalai, etc) and the climax of the film definitely proves this. This is not to say that there are no lags in the film but the superb performance of Vijay and the large ensemble cast makes you forgive this. The director capitalises totally on Vijay's trademark charm, sentiment, action, dance and humour and this is sure to appeal to his fans and the audience.GOAT is a Venkat Prabhu treat for Thalapathy Vijay fans and the audience. This Vijay film is an action-packed, fun, wholesome entertainer!\", \"Watched this movie on Netflix with great expectations. But starting with initial fight sequence, everything about this movie including background music, script, direction, editing was big let down. Background music was average, nothing outstanding. Same with music. Storyline, editing and direction was below average. Its almost 3 hours movie and one would need patience to watch it completely. I watched it in fast forward mode. After some 1 hour 40 minutes, you can directly jump to last 10mins. You wont miss anything.The storyline was predictable, and didn't make any sense. Good that we didnt spend money watching it in theatre.\", \"It's a ok movie I watched it in theatres fdfs with expectations but the movie was just an above average movie the main highlight is our thalapathy annan his perfomence was the best others were just ok his character as jeevan was so crazy it was the main highlight and the songs were so bad no special bgm Or any impact yuvan did okayish the de-aging was good not a troll material the only problem is the story, plot, twist and the lengthy runtime it was boring the first half was waste the second half was so good but the climax was not good anyway it's not everyones cup of tea and fans will enjoy 12.\"]\n"

T an action thriller film written and directed by venkat prabhu who had previously directed custody which was also a dissappointing one the storyline of the goat is very routine and ordinary to say simply it revolves around gandhi and his teammates ( sunil, kalyan, Ajay ) who are the members of the special anti- terriost squad (SATS )headed by nazeer undergoes a mission in keneya years ago which makes serious issues in their personal years after years how gandhi and his teammtes faces and solves the issues form the rest of the story talking about the postives the first major postive is none other than thalapathy vijay his performance as both Gandhi and jeevan ( father and son ) was brilliant and especially during emotional sequences his performance was top notch and rather than performances he also scores in his usual areas such as action, dance homour etc he is the main pillar of the film other actors such as prashanth, prabhudeva, sneha, ajmal ameer, jayaram, laila, mohan, meenkshi choudary, yogi babu and venkat prabhu's usual artists have done their roles effectively no complaints but some of their characters are not properly written the next positive is the some of the homour sequences involving vijay and sneha, vijay and his teammates and vijay and yogi babu were worked well especially yogi babu's some of the comedies were hilarious the total first half barring the interval point was interesting with no drag moments and it is also a notable postive the next positive is the perfect de aging technic used for vijay's jeevan character prior release the de aging was heavily criticized but in the film it was convincing which had highly saved the film the screenplay by venkat prabhu was crisp and taut in some parts ( pre interval and climax sequences )which is also a postive but also screenplay was highly predictable during some of the scenes the twists and turns in the movie also worked in some parts and it was also predictable in many scenes the easter eggs and the surprising cameos were interesting and entertaining but did not jell with the storyline and also not created a strong impact the background score by yuvanshankar raja was not great but still it was not worst too it was a good one and elevated some of the average scenes to some extent which is also a big positive the jeevan character was written in an effective way and becomes a memorable one than that of the Gandhi 's character the climax sequences was also very good and writing by venkat prabhu was very good on some parts of the movie which is also a positive thing coming to the negatives of the film the first main negative was it's very routine ordinary and generic storyline the story highly resembled vijayakanth 's film rajadurai which was directed by vijay's father sa chandrasekar and Also some of the old commercial tamil films the screenplay as mentioned above was good in some parts but in major parts it fumbles and becomes highly predictable and the twist and turns also become highly prediticable especially in interval and post interval scenes because of weak writing also the characters other than vijay are weakly written especially female characters were highly pathetic and antangoinst role by mohan were highly underwhelming even through mohan's performance was good also the deaging for the character jeevan was good but it also become worst in the post interval scenes where jeevan character was shown much more younger also the other vfx and graphics was also very creepy and looked highly artificial the songs and the placement of them were highly tertible and highly affected the flow of the film especially the song placements of spark and matta were the major drawbacks also the most shocking disappointment was the technical side 's inefficiency cinemotagraphy by siddharata nuni who had done great camera work in vendu thanithathu kadu and capital miller was highly erratic especially in the bangtok sequences and editing was also very narrow and uneven and most surprisingly the action sequences by dhilip subbarayan who had done a brillant work in valimai was highly underwhelming in this movie except the terrific bike chase featuring both vijays in Russia all the other action sequences were not convincing and illogical especially the intro train fight metro fight and even climax too and the tribute they gaven to the late captain vijayakanth in AI was highly shoddy and they would have even avoided this rather than giving a legend a lathergic tribute like this and also Easter eggs which was entertaining beccomes irritating when it becomes over dosage to conclude goat is not the greatest of all time in both vijay and venkat prabhu's career but still it is good despite major flaws effective writing and high technical brillance would have made the film to justify its title overall a partially entertaining commercial potboiler far better than vijay and venkat prabhu's previous outings which will be a delightful watch for his fans and a decent watch for others worth one time watchable in theatre postives : thalapathy vijay's screenpresence and performance, homour portions, jeevan's character arch

            "Sentence: A. T an action thriller film written and directed by venkat prabhu who had previously directed custody which was also a dissappointing one the storyline of the goat is very routine and ordinary to say simply it revolves around gandhi and his teammates ( sunil, kalyan, Ajay ) who are the members of the special anti- terriost squad (SATS )headed by nazeer undergoes a mission in keneya years ago which makes serious issues in their personal years after years how gandhi and his teammtes faces and solves the issues form the rest of the story talking about the postives the first major postive is none other than thalapathy vijay his performance as both Gandhi and jeevan ( father and son ) was brilliant and especially during emotional sequences his performance was top notch and rather than performances he also scores in his usual areas such as action, dance homour etc he is the main pillar of the film other actors such as prashanth, prabhudeva, sneha, ajmal ameer, jayaram, laila, mohan, meenkshi choudary, yogi babu and venkat prabhu's usual artists have done their roles effectively no complaints but some of their characters are not properly written the next positive is the some of the homour sequences involving vijay and sneha, vijay and his teammates and vijay and yogi babu were worked well especially yogi babu's some of the comedies were hilarious the total first half barring the interval point was interesting with no drag moments and it is also a notable postive the next positive is the perfect de aging technic used for vijay's jeevan character prior release the de aging was heavily criticized but in the film it was convincing which had highly saved the film the screenplay by venkat prabhu was crisp and taut in some parts ( pre interval and climax sequences )which is also a postive but also screenplay was highly predictable during some of the scenes the twists and turns in the movie also worked in some parts and it was also predictable in many scenes the easter eggs and the surprising cameos were interesting and entertaining but did not jell with the storyline and also not created a strong impact the background score by yuvanshankar raja was not great but still it was not worst too it was a good one and elevated some of the average scenes to some extent which is also a big positive the jeevan character was written in an effective way and becomes a memorable one than that of the Gandhi 's character the climax sequences was also very good and writing by venkat prabhu was very good on some parts of the movie which is also a positive thing coming to the negatives of the film the first main negative was it's very routine ordinary and generic storyline the story highly resembled vijayakanth 's film rajadurai which was directed by vijay's father sa chandrasekar and Also some of the old commercial tamil films the screenplay as mentioned above was good in some parts but in major parts it fumbles and becomes highly predictable and the twist and turns also become highly prediticable especially in interval and post interval scenes because of weak writing also the characters other than vijay are weakly written especially female characters were highly pathetic and antangoinst role by mohan were highly underwhelming even through mohan's performance was good also the deaging for the character jeevan was good but it also become worst in the post interval scenes where jeevan character was shown much more younger also the other vfx and graphics was also very creepy and looked highly artificial the songs and the placement of them were highly tertible and highly affected the flow of the film especially the song placements of spark and matta were the major drawbacks also the most shocking disappointment was the technical side 's inefficiency cinemotagraphy by siddharata nuni who had done great camera work in vendu thanithathu kadu and capital miller was highly erratic especially in the bangtok sequences and editing was also very narrow and uneven and most surprisingly the action sequences by dhilip subbarayan who had done a brillant work in valimai was highly underwhelming in this movie except the terrific bike chase featuring both vijays in Russia all the other action sequences were not convincing and illogical especially the intro train fight metro fight and even climax too and the tribute they gaven to the late captain vijayakanth in AI was highly shoddy and they would have even avoided this rather than giving a legend a lathergic tribute like this and also Easter eggs which was entertaining beccomes irritating when it becomes over dosage to conclude goat is not the greatest of all time in both vijay and venkat prabhu's career but still it is good despite major flaws effective writing and high technical brillance would have made the film to justify its title overall a partially entertaining commercial potboiler far better than vijay and venkat prabhu's previous outings which will be a delightful watch for his fans and a decent watch for others worth one time watchable in theatre postives : thalapathy vijay's screenpresence and performance, homour portions, jeevan's character arch
